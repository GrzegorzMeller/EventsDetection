Events began on May 5 1945 in the last moments of the war in Europe. The uprising went on until May 8 1945 ending in a ceasefire between the Czech resistance and the German army which decided to quit Prague on the same day. Next morning the Red Army entered the nearly liberated city. ,1

The Maquis du Vercors used the prominent scenic plateau known as the massif du Vercors Vercors Plateau as a refuge. Many members of the maquis called maquisards died fighting in 1944 in the Vercors Plateau. ,1

The brigade was named after Jan Žižka the 15th century leader of the Hussite army whose use of innovative techniques such as the wagon fort and the large scale use of firearms made him a Czech national hero. During the Second World War there were two additional partisan formations that separately also used Jan Žižkas name: the Jan Žižka Moravskoslezský formerly the Bílá Lvice resistance unit operating further north in the Czech lands and the Czechoslovak Brigade of Jan Žižka in Yugoslavia operating in the Balkans. ,1
3,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liberation_of_Paris,The Liberation of Paris also known as the Battle for Paris was a military action that took place during World War II from 19 August 1944 until the German garrison surrendered the French capital on 25 August 1944. Paris had been ruled by Nazi Germany since the signing of the Second Compiègne Armistice on 22 June 1940 after which the Wehrmacht occupied northern and western France. The liberation began when the French Forces of the Interior—the military structure of the French Resistance—staged an uprising against the German garrison upon the approach of the US Third Army led by General George Patton. On the night of 24 August elements of General Philippe Leclercs 2nd French Armored Division the Régiment de marche du Tchad a mechanised infantry unit led by Captain Raymond Dronne and composed primarily of exiled Spanish republicans made its way into Paris and arrived at the Hôtel de Ville shortly before midnight. The next morning 25 August the bulk of the 2nd Armored Division and US 4th Infantry Division entered the city. Dietrich von Choltitz commander of the German garrison and the military governor of Paris surrendered to the French at the Hôtel Meurice the newly established French headquarters while General Charles de Gaulle arrived to assume control of the city as head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic. ,1
4,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Operation_Ostra_Brama,Operation Ostra Brama lit. Operation Sharp Gate English: Operation Gate of Dawn was an armed conflict during World War II between the Polish Home Army and the Nazi German occupiers of Vilnius Polish: Wilno. It began on 7 July 1944 as part of a Polish national uprising Operation Tempest and lasted until 14 July 1944. Though the Germans were defeated the following day the Soviet Red Army entered the city and the Soviet NKVD proceeded to intern Polish soldiers and to arrest their officers. Several days later the remains of the Polish Home Army retreated into the forests and the Soviets were in control of the city. From the Polish point of view while the German defeat constitutes a Polish tactical victory the ensuing destruction of the Polish units by the Soviets resulted in a strategic defeat especially considering the goals of Operation Tempest. From the Soviet point of view the operation was a complete success as both the Germans and the Poles loyal to the London government suffered a defeat. The main reason for the operation was for propaganda purposes - to claim rights for Wilna. ,1
5,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warsaw_Uprising,The Warsaw Uprising Polish: powstanie warszawskie was a major World War II operation by the Polish resistance Home Army Polish: Armia Krajowa to liberate Warsaw from Nazi Germany. The Uprising was timed to coincide with the Soviet Union\s Red Army approaching the eastern suburbs of the city and the retreat of German forces. However the Soviet advance stopped short enabling the Germans to regroup and demolish the city while defeating the Polish resistance which fought for 63 days with little outside support. The Uprising was the largest single military effort taken by any European resistance movement during World War II. The Uprising began on 1 August 1944 as part of a nationwide plan Operation Tempest when the Soviet Army approached Warsaw. The main Polish objectives were to drive the German occupiers from the city and help with the larger fight against Germany and the Axis powers. Secondary political objectives were to liberate Warsaw before the Soviets to underscore Polish sovereignty by empowering the Polish Underground State before the Soviet-backed Polish Committee of National Liberation could assume control. Also short-term causes included the threat of a German round-up of able-bodied Poles and Moscow radio calling for the Uprising to begin. Initially the Poles established control over most of central Warsaw but the Soviets ignored Polish attempts to establish radio contact and did not advance beyond the city limits. Intense street fighting between the Germans and Poles continued. By 14 September Polish forces under Soviet high command occupied the east bank of the Vistula river opposite the resistance positions; but only 1200 men made it across to the west bank and they were not reinforced by the bulk of the Red Army. This and the lack of Soviet air support from a base 5 minutes flying time away led to allegations that Joseph Stalin tactically halted his forces to let the operation fail and allow the Polish resistance to be crushed. Arthur Koestler called the Soviet attitude one of the major infamies of this war which will rank for the future historian on the same ethical level with Lidice. Winston Churchill pleaded with Stalin and Franklin D. Roosevelt to help Britain\s Polish allies to no avail. Then without Soviet air clearance Churchill sent over 200 low-level supply drops by the Royal Air Force the South African Air Force and the Polish Air Force under British High Command. Later after gaining Soviet air clearance the U.S. Army Air Force sent one high-level mass airdrop as part of Operation Frantic. The Soviet Union refused to allow American bombers from Western Europe to land on Soviet airfields after dropping supplies to the Poles. Although the exact number of casualties remains unknown it is estimated that about 16000 members of the Polish resistance were killed and about 6000 badly wounded. In addition between 150000 and 200000 Polish civilians died mostly from mass executions. Jews being harboured by Poles were exposed by German house-to-house clearances and mass evictions of entire neighbourhoods. German casualties totalled over 8000 soldiers killed and missing and 9000 wounded. During the urban combat approximately 25% of Warsaw\s buildings were destroyed. Following the surrender of Polish forces German troops systematically levelled another 35% of the city block by block. Together with earlier damage suffered in the 1939 invasion of Poland and the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943 over 85% of the city was destroyed by January 1945 when the course of the events in the Eastern Front forced the Germans to abandon the city. ,1

The name is also given to the military conflict that opposed Resistance fighters to German Vichy and Milice forces. ,1
7,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maquis_du_Mont_Mouchet,The Maquis du Mont Mouchet were a group of French resistance fighters during the Second World War. Based at Mont Mouchet its goal was to delay the convergence of German forces in the south of France with those in Normandy in order to aid the allies in the reconquest of France. The Germans having discovered the maquis made several attacks up until May 1944 with about 3000 men and using aviation and armoured units. The maquisards fought back fiercely. Little information is available on the German forces. Historians have identified some units: \n*  The Jesser Brigade formed from veterans of the eastern front deployed in the Orléans-Pithiviers sector \n*  1000 men from the Sicherungs Motorisierte regiment \n*  1000 men from the Aufklärungs Abteilung These were reinforced from: \n*  Regiment 2 of the 2 Ost Bataillon of the Freiwilligen Stamm:  \n*  The Volga Tatar legion stationed at Puy-en-Velay \n*  The Azerbaijan legion stationed at Rodez former 804th battalion ? \n*  The 3rd Battalion of the SS Polizei Regiment 19 \n*  A battery of the artillery regiment 28 189th reserve division \n*  Battalion of DCA 958 \n*  3 motorised response detachments of the Feldgendarmerie \n*  An armored reconnaissance platoon originating from Paris \n*  2 Luftwaffe squadrons from Aulnat airbase After several days of combat the final German attack forced the maquisards to fall back and disperse. Out of revenge for their previous losses the Germans pillaged several of the surrounding villages including Clavières. In the course of the battles the French Forces of the Interior sustained severe losses: 238 killed and 180 wounded as well as about 100 hostages executed by the Nazis. ,1
8,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_coup_d'état_in_French_Indochina,The Japanese coup détat in French Indochina known as Meigo Sakusen Operation Bright Moon was a Japanese operation that took place on 9 March 1945 towards the end of World War II. With Japanese forces losing the war and the threat of an allied invasion of Indochina imminent the Japanese were concerned about an uprising against them by French colonial forces. Despite the French having anticipated an attack the Japanese struck in a military campaign attacking garrisons all over the colony. The French were caught off guard and all of the garrisons were overrun with some then having to escape to Nationalist China where they were harshly interned. The Japanese replaced French officials and effectively dismantled their control of Indochina. The Japanese were then able to install and create a new Empire of Vietnam Kingdom of Cambodia and Kingdom of Laos which under their direction would acquiesce with their military presence and forestall a potential invasion by the allies. ,1
9,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1940–44_insurgency_in_Chechnya,The 1940–44 insurgency in Chechnya was an autonomous revolt against the Soviet authorities in the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Beginning as early as in June 1941 under Khasan Israilov it peaked in 1942 during the German invasion of North Caucasus and ended in the beginning of 1944 with the wholesale concentration and deportation of the Vainakh peoples Chechens and Ingushes from their native lands as well as from the locations across the USSR resulting in the death of at least 144000 civilians. However a scattered resistance in the mountains continued for years. ,1
10,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slovak_National_Uprising,The Slovak National Uprising Slovak: Slovenské národné povstanie abbreviated SNP or 1944 Uprising was an armed insurrection organized by the Slovak resistance movement during World War II. This resistance movement was represented mainly by the members of the Civic democratic movement but also by representatives and members of the pre-war Social democrats and Communists albeit on a smaller scale. It was launched on 29 August 1944 from Banská Bystrica in an attempt to resist German troops that had occupied Slovak territory and to overthrow the collaborationist government of Jozef Tiso. Although the resistance was largely defeated by German forces guerrilla operations continued until the Soviet Army Czechoslovak Army and Romanian Army liberated Slovakia in 1945. In the post-war period many political entities attempted to hijack the uprising to their credit mainly the Communists. The Stalinist regime in Czechoslovakia presented the Uprising as an event initiated and governed by Communist forces. Slovak ultranationalists on the other hand claim that the uprising was a plot against the Slovak nation as one of its main objectives was to oust the regime of the puppet Slovak state and reestablish Czechoslovakia in which Slovaks were dominated by Czechs. In fact many factions fought in the uprising the largest of which were units of the Slovak Army Democratic resistance and Communist partisans and international forces. Given this factionalization the Uprising did not have unambiguous popular support. Yet the participants and supporters of the Uprising represented every religion class age and anti-Nazi political faction of the Slovak nation. ,1

The murders were a part of Intelligenzaktion in Pomerania a Nazi action aimed at the elimination of the Polish intelligentsia in Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia which included the former Pomeranian Voivodeship Polish Corridor. It was part of a larger genocidal action that took place in all German occupied Poland code-named Operation Tannenberg. ,1
14,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Commissar_Order,The Commissar Order German: Kommissarbefehl was an order issued by the German High Command OKW on 6 June 1941 before Operation Barbarossa. Its official name was Guidelines for the Treatment of Political Commissars Richtlinien für die Behandlung politischer Kommissare. It instructed the Wehrmacht that any Soviet political commissar identified among captured troops be summarily executed as an enforcer of the Judeo-Bolshevism ideology in military forces. According to the order all those prisoners who could be identified as thoroughly bolshevized or as active representatives of the Bolshevist ideology should also be killed. ,1
15,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeziorko_woodland_cemetery,Woodland cemetery in Jeziorko village in the Northeastern part of Poland is located approximately 7 kilometers 4.3 mi from the town of Łomża along Route 668. The remains of victims murdered by the Nazi troops rest in the cemetery which is among very few with almost completely documented history of events that happened during the Nazi occupation. Three mass graves are related to three executions that took place there. First in June 1942 the exact date is still unknown approximately 60 elderly people from a nursing home of nearby Pieńki Borowe were murdered. The names of 13 victims were identified with the majority still remaining unknown. Second on the night of June 29/30 1943 the military police executed 62 political prisoners transported to the Jeziorko forest from the prison in Łomża. The third grave is a burial site of 52 victims including children and elderly members of more than a dozen of families arrested as hostages in their homes in Łomża at dawn on July 15 1943. They were taken to the prison and then transported to the Jeziorko forest where they were executed. The execution was carried out by a special unit known as the Müller group after the name of its commander created by Erich Koch the East Prussia Gauleiter i.e. a district leader in Nazi Germany who served as a provincial governor. In autumn of 1944 a German unit Sonderkommando 1005 exhumed the corpses and burned them to obliterate the evidence of the murders. In spring of 1945 after Nazi forces left the Łomża region the cemetery in the Jeziorko forest with three mass graves was created by the efforts of inhabitants of Łomża. In 2005 the Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites acknowledged the cemetery as the Site of National Remembrance. ,1
16,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massacres_in_Piaśnica,The massacres in Piaśnica were a set of mass executions carried out by Nazi Germany during World War II between the fall of 1939 and spring of 1940 in Piaśnica Wielka Groß Piasnitz in the Darzlubska Wilderness near Wejherowo. The exact number of people murdered is unknown but estimates range between 12000 and 14000 victims. Most of them were Polish intellectuals from Gdańsk Pomerania but Poles Jews Czechs and German inmates from mental hospitals from General Government and the Third Reich were also murdered. After the Stutthof concentration camp Piaśnica was the largest site of killings of Polish civilians in Pomerania by the Germans and for this reason is sometimes referred to as the second or Pomeranian Katyn. It was the first large scale Nazi atrocity in occupied Poland. ,1

It was ordered by Generaloberst Kurt Student in reprisal for the participation of the local population in the Battle of Crete that had held advancing German soldiers for two days. The destruction constituted one of the most atrocious war crimes committed during the occupation of Crete by Axis forces in World War II. ,1
18,http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_war_crimes,The governments of the German Empire and Nazi Germany ordered organized and condoned a substantial number of war crimes in World War I and World War II respectively. The most notable of these is the Holocaust in which millions of people were systematically murdered or died from abuse and mistreatment. Millions also died as a result of other German actions in those two conflicts. The true number of victims may never be known since much of the evidence was deliberately destroyed by the perpetrators in an attempt to conceal the crimes. ,1

20,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Porajmos,The Romani genocide or Romani Holocaust also known as the Porajmos Romani pronunciation: IPA: pʰoɽajˈmos] Pharrajimos Cutting up Fragmentation Destruction or Samudaripen Mass killing was the planned and attempted effort often described as a genocide during World War II by the government of Nazi Germany and its allies to exterminate the Romani Gypsy people of Europe. Under the rule of Adolf Hitler a supplementary decree to the Nuremberg Laws was issued on 26 November 1935 defining Gypsies as enemies of the race-based state the same category as Jews. Thus the fate of Roma in Europe in some ways paralleled that of the Jews. Historians estimate that 220000 to 500000 Romani were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators or more than 25% of the slightly fewer than 1 million Roma in Europe at the time. Ian Hancock puts the death toll as high as 1.5 million. In 1982 West Germany formally recognized that genocide had been committed against the Romani. In 2011 the Polish Government passed a resolution for the official recognition of 2 August as a day of commemoration of the genocide. ,1

Most of the Jews were exterminated in Ustaše-run concentration camps like Jasenovac and others while a considerable number of Jews were rounded up and turned over by the Ustaše for extermination in Nazi Germany. ,1
23,http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Holocaust,Holocaust and Shoah redirect here. For other uses see Holocaust disambiguation and Shoah disambiguation. The Holocaust from the Greek ὁλόκαυστος holókaustos: hólos whole and kaustós burnt also known as the Shoah Hebrew: השואה HaShoah the catastrophe was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler\s Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany German-occupied territories and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. From 1941 to 1945 Jews were systematically murdered in one of the deadliest genocides in history which was part of a broader aggregate of acts of oppression and killings of various ethnic and political groups in Europe by the Nazi regime. Under the coordination of the SS following directions from the highest leadership of the Nazi Party every arm of Germany\s bureaucracy was involved in the logistics and the carrying out of the genocide. Other victims of Nazi crimes included ethnic Poles Soviet citizens and Soviet POWs other Slavs Romanis communists homosexuals Freemasons Jehovah\s Witnesses and the mentally and physically disabled. A network of about 42500 facilities in Germany and German-occupied territories was used to concentrate victims for slave labor mass murder and other human rights abuses. Over 200000 people are estimated to have been Holocaust perpetrators. The persecution and genocide were carried out in stages culminating in what Nazis termed the Final Solution to the Jewish Question die Endlösung der Judenfrage an agenda to exterminate Jews in Europe. Initially the German government passed laws to exclude Jews from civil society most prominently the Nuremberg Laws of 1935. Nazis established a network of concentration camps starting in 1933 and ghettos following the outbreak of World War II in 1939. In 1941 as Germany conquered new territory in eastern Europe specialized paramilitary units called Einsatzgruppen murdered around two million Jews partisans and others often in mass shootings. By the end of 1942 victims were being regularly transported by freight trains to extermination camps where if they survived the journey most were systematically killed in gas chambers. This continued until the end of World War II in Europe in April–May 1945. Jewish armed resistance was limited. The most notable exception was the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943 when thousands of poorly-armed Jewish fighters held the Waffen-SS at bay for four weeks. An estimated 20000–30000 Jewish partisans actively fought against the Nazis and their collaborators in Eastern Europe. French Jews took part in the French Resistance which conducted a guerilla campaign against the Nazis and Vichy French authorities. Over a hundred armed Jewish uprisings took place. ,1
24,http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_March_(1945),The March refers to a series of forced marches during the final stages of the Second World War in Europe. From a total of 257000 western Allied prisoners of war held in German military prison camps over 80000 POWs were forced to march westward across Poland Czechoslovakia and Germany in extreme winter conditions over about four months between January and April 1945. This series of events has been called various names: The Great March West The Long March The Long Walk The Long Trek The Black March The Bread March and Death March Across Germany but most survivors just called it The March. As the Soviet Army was advancing German authorities decided to evacuate POW camps to delay liberation of the prisoners. At the same time hundreds of thousands of German civilian refugees most of them women and children as well as civilians of other nationalities were also making their way westward on foot. Notorious examples include: \n* from Stalag Luft IV at Gross Tychow in Pomerania the prisoners faced a 800 km 500 mi trek in blizzard conditions across Germany during which hundreds died and; \n* a march from Stalag VIII-B known as the Lamsdorf Death March which was similar to the better-known Bataan Death March 1942 in terms of mortality rates. \n* from Stalag Luft III in Silesia to Bavaria ,1

The shootings were conducted with the use of a proscription list Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen compiled by the Gestapo in the span of two years before the 1939 attack. The top secret lists identified more than 61000 members of the Polish elite: activists intelligentsia scholars actors former officers and others who were to be interned or shot. Members of the German minority living in Poland assisted in preparing the lists. It is estimated that up to 20000 Germans living in Poland belonged to organizations involved in various forms of subversion. Operation Tannenberg was closely followed by the Intelligenzaktion a second phase of the Unternehmen Tannenberg directed by Heydrichs Sonderreferat from Berlin. It lasted until January 1940.

30,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Szczurowa_massacre,The massacre in Szczurowa was the murder of 93 Romani people also known as Gypsies including children women and the elderly by German Nazi occupiers in the Polish village of Szczurowa on August 3 1943. Between ten and twenty families of settled Romani had lived in Szczurowa for generations alongside ethnic Poles with whom they had friendly and neighborly relations. They were integrated enough into the general community that there were several mixed marriages. On August 3 1943 German police rounded up almost all the Romani inhabitants of the village and transported them to the local cemetery where they were shot. A list of all the victims has been preserved in the documents of the local church. On May 8 1956 local inhabitants of the village and members of local veterans associations erected a memorial stone with a suitable inscription at the site of the mass grave of the victims. This became the first memorial commemorating victims of the Romani Holocaust in the world. The memorial is cared for by local schoolchildren and the memory of the tragedy is part of the local historical consciousness. Since 1960 Romanies from Tarnów have been coming to the region to honor the memory of the victims. Since 1996 the International Romani Caravan of Memory travels around the Tarnów region to commemorate the Nazi mass murder of Romanies during World War II. The main stop of the caravan is Szczurowa where after a visit to the mass grave a mass is held at the local church. The Tarnów region was a site of other Nazi crimes against Romanies in addition to that at Szczurowa. Most of the victims identities and their place of burial are unknown. Other mass graves of murdered Romanies in the region include those at Bielcza 28 murdered Borzęcin Dolny 28 murdered and Żabno 49 murdered. The Romani people who lived in Europe from the 15th century were among the groups singled out by the Nazi Germany regime for persecution and were often murdered along with the Jews. Between 500000 and 1500000 Romanies were killed by the Nazis throughout Europe during the Holocaust. ,1
31,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ascq_massacre,The Ascq massacre is a massacre of 86 men on 1 April 1944 in Ascq France by the Waffen-SS during the Second World War. The 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend set out by rail for Normandy at the end of March 1944. On 1 April their train was approaching the gare dAscq a critical juncture where three railroads intersected when an explosion blew the line apart causing two cars to derail. The commander of the convoy SS Obersturmführer Walter Hauck ordered troops to search and arrest all male members of the houses on both sides of the track. Altogether 70 men were shot beside the railway line and another 16 killed in the village itself. Six other men were arrested charged with bomb attack after an investigation by the Gestapo and finally executed by firing squad. At the end of the war some SS men stood trial in a French Military Court at Lille. They were sentenced to death; later their sentences were commuted to imprisonment. The last prisoner Walter Hauck was released in July 1957. Hauck also instigated a similar massacre in Leskovice in May 1945. After the massacre 60000 workers started a strike in Lille — which is one of the most important demonstration in France during the World War II under German occupation — and minimum 20000 people were present at the funerals in the village. ,1
32,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Occupation_of_Poland_(1939–45),The occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during the Second World War 1939–1945 began with the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939 and formally concluded with the defeat of Germany by the Allies in May 1945. Throughout the entire course of foreign occupation the territory of Poland was divided between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union USSR with the intention of eradicating Polish culture and subjugating its people by occupying German and Soviet powers. In summer-autumn of 1941 the lands annexed by the Soviets were overrun by Nazi Germany in the course of the initially successful German attack on the USSR. After a few years of fighting the Red Army was able to repel the invaders and drive the Nazi forces out of the USSR and across Poland from the rest of Eastern and Central Europe. Both occupying powers were equally hostile to the existence of sovereign Poland Polish culture and the Polish people aiming at their destruction. Before Operation Barbarossa Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union coordinated their Poland-related policies most visibly in the four Gestapo-NKVD Conferences where the occupants discussed plans for dealing with the Polish resistance movement and future destruction of Poland. About 6 million Polish citizens—nearly 21.4% of Polands population—died between 1939 and 1945 as a result of the occupation half of whom were Polish Jews. Over 90% of the death toll came through non-military losses as most of the civilians were targeted by various deliberate actions by Germans and the Soviets. Overall during German occupation of pre-war Polish territory 1939–1945 the Germans murdered 5470000–5670000 Poles including nearly 3000000 Jews. ,1

Rudolfa Weigla in Lwów Lviv Ukraine. It involved serving as a source of blood for lice a typhus vector which could then be used to develop vaccines against the disease. Initially begun in 1920 by Weigl during the Nazi occupation of the city it became the primary means of support and protection for many of the citys Polish intellectuals including the mathematician Stefan Banach and the poet Zbigniew Herbert. While the profession carried a significant risk of infection thanks to Weigls patronage the feeders of lice obtained additional food rations were protected from being shipped to slave labor in Germany or German concentration camps and were allowed additional mobility around the occupied city. Typhus research involving human subjects who were purposely infected with the disease was also carried out in various Nazi concentration camps in particular at Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen and to a lesser extent at Auschwitz. ,1

The decision to kill all the Jews in Kiev was made by the military governor Major-General Kurt Eberhard the Police Commander for Army Group South SS-Obergruppenführer Friedrich Jeckeln and the Einsatzgruppe C Commander Otto Rasch. It was carried out by Sonderkommando 4a soldiers along with the aid of the SD and SS Police Battalions backed by the local police. The massacre was the largest mass killing for which the Nazi regime and its collaborators were responsible during its campaign against the Soviet Union and is considered to be the largest single massacre in the history of the Holocaust to that particular date surpassed only by Aktion Erntefest of November 1943 in occupied Poland with 42000–43000 victims and the 1941 Odessa massacre of more than 50000 Jews in October 1941 committed by Romanian troops.

After disarmament by the Germans the Italian soldiers and officers were confronted with the choice to continue fighting as allies of the German army either in the armed forces of the Italian Social Republic the German puppet regime in northern Italy or in Italian volunteer units in the German armed forces or otherwise be sent to detention camps in Germany. Only 10 percent agreed to enroll. The others were considered prisoners of war. Later they were re-designated military internees by the Germans so as to not recognize the rights granted prisoners of war by the Third Geneva Convention and finally in the autumn of 1944 until the end of the war civilian workers so they could be subjected to hard labor without protection of the Red Cross. The Nazis considered the Italians as traitors and not as prisoners of war. The former Italian soldiers were sent into forced labor in war industries 35.6% heavy industry 7.1% mining 28.5% construction 5.9% and agriculture 14.3%. The working conditions were very bad.

The premise behind the Hunger Plan was that Germany was not self-sufficient in food supplies and to sustain the war and keep up the domestic morale it needed to obtain the food from conquered lands at any cost. It was an engineered famine planned and implemented as an act of policy. This plan was developed during the planning phase for the Wehrmacht German Armed Forces invasion and provided for diverting of the Ukrainian food stuffs away from central and northern Russia and redirecting them for the benefit of the invading army and the population in Germany. The plan resulted in the deaths of millions of people. The plan as a means of mass murder was outlined in several documents including one that became known as Göring\s Green Folder which quoted a number of 20 to 30 million expected Russian deaths from military actions and crises of food supply. ,1

58,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warsaw_Uprising,The Warsaw Uprising Polish: powstanie warszawskie was a major World War II operation by the Polish resistance Home Army Polish: Armia Krajowa to liberate Warsaw from Nazi Germany. The Uprising was timed to coincide with the Soviet Union\s Red Army approaching the eastern suburbs of the city and the retreat of German forces. However the Soviet advance stopped short enabling the Germans to regroup and demolish the city while defeating the Polish resistance which fought for 63 days with little outside support. The Uprising was the largest single military effort taken by any European resistance movement during World War II. The Uprising began on 1 August 1944 as part of a nationwide plan Operation Tempest when the Soviet Army approached Warsaw. The main Polish objectives were to drive the German occupiers from the city and help with the larger fight against Germany and the Axis powers. Secondary political objectives were to liberate Warsaw before the Soviets to underscore Polish sovereignty by empowering the Polish Underground State before the Soviet-backed Polish Committee of National Liberation could assume control. Also short-term causes included the threat of a German round-up of able-bodied Poles and Moscow radio calling for the Uprising to begin. Initially the Poles established control over most of central Warsaw but the Soviets ignored Polish attempts to establish radio contact and did not advance beyond the city limits. Intense street fighting between the Germans and Poles continued. By 14 September Polish forces under Soviet high command occupied the east bank of the Vistula river opposite the resistance positions; but only 1200 men made it across to the west bank and they were not reinforced by the bulk of the Red Army. This and the lack of Soviet air support from a base 5 minutes flying time away led to allegations that Joseph Stalin tactically halted his forces to let the operation fail and allow the Polish resistance to be crushed. Arthur Koestler called the Soviet attitude one of the major infamies of this war which will rank for the future historian on the same ethical level with Lidice. Winston Churchill pleaded with Stalin and Franklin D. Roosevelt to help Britain\s Polish allies to no avail. Then without Soviet air clearance Churchill sent over 200 low-level supply drops by the Royal Air Force the South African Air Force and the Polish Air Force under British High Command. Later after gaining Soviet air clearance the U.S. Army Air Force sent one high-level mass airdrop as part of Operation Frantic. The Soviet Union refused to allow American bombers from Western Europe to land on Soviet airfields after dropping supplies to the Poles. Although the exact number of casualties remains unknown it is estimated that about 16000 members of the Polish resistance were killed and about 6000 badly wounded. In addition between 150000 and 200000 Polish civilians died mostly from mass executions. Jews being harboured by Poles were exposed by German house-to-house clearances and mass evictions of entire neighbourhoods. German casualties totalled over 8000 soldiers killed and missing and 9000 wounded. During the urban combat approximately 25% of Warsaw\s buildings were destroyed. Following the surrender of Polish forces German troops systematically levelled another 35% of the city block by block. Together with earlier damage suffered in the 1939 invasion of Poland and the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943 over 85% of the city was destroyed by January 1945 when the course of the events in the Eastern Front forced the Germans to abandon the city. ,1

The Rumbula massacre was carried out by the Nazi Einsatzgruppe A with the help of local collaborators of the Arajs Kommando with support from other such Latvian auxiliaries. In charge of the operation was Higher SS and Police Leader Friedrich Jeckeln who had previously overseen similar massacres in the Ukraine. Rudolf Lange who later participated in the Wannsee Conference also took part in organising the massacre. Some of the accusations against Latvian Herberts Cukurs are related to the clearing of the Riga Ghetto by the Arajs Kommando. The Rumbula killings together with many others formed the basis of the post-World War II Einsatzgruppen trial where a number of Einsatzgruppen commanders were found guilty of crimes against humanity. ,1
69,http://dbpedia.org/resource/War_crimes_of_the_Wehrmacht,War crimes of the Wehrmacht were those carried out by the German armed forces during World War II. While the Schutzstaffel SS in particular the SS-Totenkopfverbände Einsatzgruppen and Waffen-SS of Nazi Germany was the organization most responsible for the genocidal killing of the Holocaust the regular armed forces represented by the Wehrmacht committed war crimes of their own particularly on the Eastern Front in the war against the Soviet Union. The Nuremberg Trials at the end of World War II judged that the Wehrmacht was not a criminal organization under the very technical legal grounds that because of very poor co-ordination between the German Army Navy and Air Force which operated as more or less separate fiefdoms during the war that the Wehrmacht did not constitute an organization as defined by Article 9 of the constitution of the International Military Tribunal IMT which conducted the Nuremberg trials. Had it not been for these very narrow legalistic reasons the Wehrmacht would have been judged a criminal organization by the IMT. This has often been misconstrued not the least by German World War Two veterans that the IMT ruled that the Wehrmacht was not a criminal organization because the Wehrmacht committed no war crimes. Most Wehrmacht war crimes were committed against Jews Romani and Slavs. ,1

Deportations of civilians conducted since the beginning of war reached unprecedented levels following Operation Barbarossa of 1941. The Ostarbeiters were apprehended from the newly formed German districts of Reichskommissariat Ukraine General Government Distrikt Galizien and Reichskommissariat Ostland which comprised the territories of German occupied Poland as well as formerly Soviet occupied Poland since 1939 and the Soviet Union itself. According to Pavel Polian over 50% of Ostarbeiters were formerly Soviet subjects originating from the territory of modern-day Ukraine followed by Polish women workers approaching 30%. Among the Eastern workers were ethnic Ukrainians Poles Belarusians Russians Tatars and others. Estimates of the number of Ostarbeiter range between 3 million and 5.5 million. By 1944 most new workers were very young under the age of 16 as those older than that were usually conscripted for service in Germany; 30% were as young as 12–14 years of age when they were taken from their homes. The age limit was dropped to 10 in November 1943. Since about half of the adolescents were female Ostarbeiter were often the victims of rape and tens of thousands of pregnancies due to rape occurred. Ostarbeiter were often given starvation rations and were forced to live in guarded camps. Many died from starvation overwork bombing they were frequently denied access to bomb shelters abuse and execution carried out by their German overseers. Ostarbeiter were often denied wages but when they did get paid they received payment in a special currency which could only be used to buy specific products at the camps where they lived. Following the war the over 2.5 million liberated Ostarbeiter were often repatriated and in the USSR they suffered from social ostracization as well as deportation to gulags for re-education. American authorities banned the repatriation of Ostarbeiter in October 1945 and some immigrated to the U.S. as well as other non eastern-bloc countries. In 2000 the German government and thousands of German companies paid a one-time payment of just over € 5 billion to Ostarbeiter victims of the Nazi regime. ,1

The plan was put into full motion after the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. The uprising had infuriated German leaders who now wanted to make an example of the city which they had long before selected for a major reconstruction as part of their plans to Germanize Central Europe: The city must completely disappear from the surface of the earth and serve only as a transport station for the Wehrmacht. No stone can remain standing. Every building must be razed to its foundation.—\u2009SS chief Heinrich Himmler October 17 1944 SS officers conferenceWarsaw has to be pacified that is razed to the ground.—\u2009Adolf Hitler 1944 Even before the uprising the Germans knew Warsaw would fall into Allied hands in a matter of few months. In spite of this unprecedented effort was dedicated to the destruction of the city. This decision tied up considerable resources which in theory could have been used on the Eastern Front and on the newly opened Western Front after the Normandy landings. The Germans destroyed 80%-90% of the buildings in Warsaw while an immense part of the cultural heritage was deliberately demolished burned to the ground or stolen. Currently more than half of the antiques and museum objects consisting of Polish heritage stolen by Germans in 1944 have not been returned to Poland. After the war extensive work was put into rebuilding the city according to pre-war plans and historical documents. As with most of Poland the city was rebuilt without any German labor unlike in Stalingrad and other cities where German forced labor was used during and after the war as part of war reparations. ,1

These work groups were officially called Leichenkommandos corpse units and were all part of Sonderkommando 1005; inmates were often put in chains in order to prevent escape. In May 1943 the operation moved into occupied territories in Eastern Europe to destroy evidence of the Final Solution. Sonderaktion 1005 was used to conceal the evidence of massacres committed by SS-Einsatzgruppen Nazi death squads that had massacred millions of people including 1.3 million Jews according to Historian Raul Hillberg as well as Roma and local civilians in Eastern Europe.

Three months later Armed Forces High Command Feldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel expanded it to include all persons in occupied countries who had been taken into custody; if they were still alive eight days later they were to be handed over to the Gestapo. The decree was meant to intimidate local populations into submission by denying friends and families of seized persons any knowledge of their whereabouts or their fate. The prisoners were secretly transported to Germany and vanished without a trace. In 1945 the abandoned Sicherheitsdienst SD records were found to include merely names and the initials NN Nacht und Nebel; even the sites of graves were unrecorded. The Nazis even coined a new term for those who vanished in accordance with this decree; they were vernebelt—transformed into mist. To this day it is not known how many thousands of people disappeared as a result of this order.

At the Nuremberg Tribunal three categories of wartime criminality were established: waging a war of aggression war crimes and crimes against humanity. These three core crimes of international law were set apart from other crimes and for the first time since the end of the war categorised as violations of fundamental human values and norms. They were committed in occupied Poland on a tremendous scale. In 1939 the invading forces totalled 1.5 million Germans and nearly half a million Soviets. Throughout the entire course of occupation the territory of Poland was divided between Nazi Germany and the USSR. In the summer and autumn of 1941 the lands annexed by the Soviets were overrun by Nazi Germany in the course of the initially successful Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union.

In 1949 he was tried for war crimes in Hamburg was convicted of nine of seventeen charges and sentenced to eighteen years in prison. He served only four years before being released. Manstein was taken prisoner by the British in August 1945. He testified for the defence of the German General Staff and the Wehrmacht supreme command the OKW on trial at the Nuremberg trials of major Nazi war criminals and organisations in August 1946. Under pressure from the Soviet Union the British cabinet decided in July 1948 to prosecute Manstein and several other senior officers who had been held in custody since the end of the war. Manstein\s trial was held in Hamburg from 23 August to 19 December 1949. He faced seventeen charges covering activities such as authorising or permitting the killing deportation and maltreatment of Jews and other civilians; maltreating and killing prisoners of war; illegally compelling prisoners to do dangerous work and work of a military nature; ordering the execution of Soviet political commissars in compliance with Hitler\s Commissar Order; and issuing scorched earth orders while in retreat in the Crimea. Manstein was found guilty on nine of the charges and was sentenced to eighteen years in prison. His early release on 7 May 1953 was partly because of recurring health problems but also the result of pressure by Winston Churchill Konrad Adenauer B. H. Liddell Hart and other supporters. The conduct of the trial was partly responsible for creating the legend of a clean Wehrmacht – the belief that members of the German armed forces acted in isolation and were not involved or culpable for the events of the Holocaust. ,1

The Declaration was the brainchild of the German Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2007. Designed to provide renewed impetus to the process of EU reform after the ratification of the European Constitution had failed the Declaration aimed for a renewed common basis in time for the 2009 European Parliament elections. The German presidency followed up on the issue by brokering a consensus for what later became known as the Treaty of Lisbon. ,1

112,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Schengen_Agreement,The Schengen Agreement English pronunciation: /ˈʃɛŋən/ is a treaty which led to the creation of Europes Schengen Area in which internal border checks have largely been abolished. It was signed on 14 June 1985 near the town of Schengen Luxembourg by five of the ten member states of the then European Economic Community. It proposed measures intended to gradually abolish border checks at the signatories common borders including reduced speed vehicle checks which allowed vehicles to cross borders without stopping allowing residents in border areas freedom to cross borders away from fixed checkpoints and the harmonisation of visa policies. In 1990 the Agreement was supplemented by the Schengen Convention which proposed the complete abolition of systematic internal border controls and a common visa policy. The Schengen Area operates very much like a single state for international travel purposes with external border controls for travellers entering and exiting the area and common visas but with no internal border controls. It currently consists of 26 European countries covering a population of over 400 million people and an area of 4312099 square kilometres 1664911 sq mi. Originally the Schengen treaties and the rules adopted under them operated independently from the European Union. However in 1999 they were incorporated into European Union law by the Amsterdam Treaty while providing opt-outs for the only two EU member states which had remained outside the Area: Ireland and the United Kingdom. Schengen is now a core part of EU law and all EU member states without an opt-out which have not already joined the Schengen Area are legally obliged to do so when technical requirements have been met. Several non-EU countries are included in the area. ,1
113,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euratom_Treaty,The Euratom Treaty officially the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community established the European Atomic Energy Community. It was signed on the 25 March 1957 at the same time as the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community EEC Treaty. The Euratom treaty is less well-known due to the lower profile of the organisation it founded. While the EEC has evolved into what is now the European Union Euratom has remained much the same as it was in 1957 albeit governed by the institutions of the European Union. It was established with its own independent institutions but the 1967 Merger Treaty merged the institutions of Euratom and the ECSC with those of the EEC. The Euratom treaty has seen very little amendment due to the later sensitivity surrounding nuclear power amongst European public opinion. Because of this some argue that it has become too out-dated particularly in the areas of democratic oversight. It was not included as part of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe which sought to combine all previous treaties over fears that including nuclear power in the treaty would turn more people against it. It is therefore still in force today but as a separate legal treaty. It forms part of the active treaties of the European Union. ,1

It was drawn up by the Council of Europe in Strasbourg France with the active participation of the Council of Europes observer states Canada Japan South Africa and the United States. The Convention and its Explanatory Report was adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe at its 109th Session on 8 November 2001. It was opened for signature in Budapest on 23 November 2001 and it entered into force on 1 July 2004. As of March 2016 49 states have ratified the convention while a further six states had signed the convention but not ratified it. Since it entered into force important countries like Brazil and India have declined to adopt the Convention on the grounds that they did not participate in its drafting. Russia opposes the Convention stating that adoption would violate Russian sovereignty and has usually refused to cooperate in law enforcement investigations relating to cyber crime. On 1 March 2006 the Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime came into force.

It would have replaced the existing European Union treaties with a single text given legal force to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and expanded Qualified Majority Voting into policy areas which had previously been decided by unanimity among member states. The Treaty was signed on 29 October 2004 by representatives of the then 25 member states of the European Union. It was later ratified by 18 member states which included referendums endorsing it in Spain and Luxembourg. However the rejection of the document by French and Dutch voters in May and June 2005 brought the ratification process to an end. Following a period of reflection the Treaty of Lisbon was created to replace the Constitutional Treaty. This contained many of the changes that were originally placed in the Constitutional Treaty but was formulated as amendments to the existing treaties. Signed on 13 December 2007 the Lisbon Treaty entered into force on 1 December 2009. ,1

They establish the various EU institutions together with their remit procedures and objectives. The EU can only act within the competences granted to it through these treaties and amendment to the treaties requires the agreement and ratification according to their national procedures of every single signatory. Two core functional treaties the Treaty on European Union originally signed in Maastricht in 1992 and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union originally signed in Rome in 1958 as the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community lay out how the EU operates and there are a number of satellite treaties which are interconnected with them.

119,http://dbpedia.org/resource/German–Spanish_Treaty_(1899),The German–Spanish Treaty of 1899 signed by the German Empire and the Kingdom of Spain involved Spain selling the vast majority of its remaining Pacific Ocean islands to Germany for 25 million pesetas equivalent to 17 million Marks. In the course of the 19th century the Spanish Empire lost most of its colonies to  independence movements. Then came the Spanish–American War in 1898 in which Spain lost most of its remaining colonies. Cuba became independent while the United States took possession of Puerto Rico along with the Philippines and Guam from the Spanish East Indies Spains Pacific Ocean colonies. This left Spain with only its African possessions and with about 6000 tiny sparsely populated and not very productive Pacific islands. These latter were both ungovernable after the loss of the administrative center of Manila and indefensible after the destruction of two Spanish fleets in the Spanish–American War. The Spanish government therefore decided to sell the remaining islands. Germany lobbied the Spanish government to facilitate the sale of the islands to Germany. The Spanish Prime Minister Francisco Silvela signed the treaty on February 12 1899. It transferred the Caroline Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands to Germany which then placed them under the jurisdiction of German New Guinea. Palau at the time considered part of the Carolines was also occupied and during the following years the Germans started up mining there. In October 1914 during World War I Japan invaded and conquered many of these German possessions. After the war they became in 1919 the South Pacific Mandate of the League of Nations under the control of the Japanese Empire. During and after World War II the United States took control of the former Spanish and German archipelagos in the Pacific. ,1

In November 1981 the German and Italian Governments submitted to the Member States a draft European Act designed to further European integration. In accordance with the mandate given by the European Council of 26 and 27 November 1981 the Foreign Ministers reported to the Stuttgart European Council on their work on this draft Act. The Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the European Communities meeting within the European Council resolved to continue the work begun on the basis of the Treaties of Paris and Rome and to create a united Europe which is more than ever necessary in order to meet the dangers of the world situation capable of assuming the responsibilities incumbent on it by virtue of its political role its economic potential and its manifold links with other peoples ... The Heads of State or Government on the basis of an awareness of a common destiny and the wish to affirm the European identity confirm their commitment to progress towards an ever closer union among the peoples and Member States of the European Community. The Ten also used the Stuttgart Declaration to condemn international interference with the conflicts in Central America specifically in El Salvador and Nicaragua. Their statement concerning this issue reads: The Heads of State and Government confirmed their close interest in developments in Central America. They are deeply concerned at the economic and social conditions in many parts of the region at the tensions which these create and at the widespread misery and bloodshed.They are convinced that the problems of Central America cannot be solved by military means but only by a political solution springing from the region itself and respecting the principles of non-interference and inviolability of frontiers. They therefore fully support the current initiative of the Contadora Group. They underlined the need for the establishment of democratic conditions and for the strict observance of human rights throughout the region.They are ready to continue contributing to the further development in the area in order to promote progress towards stability. ,1
121,http://dbpedia.org/resource/European_Neighbourhood_Policy,The European Neighbourhood Policy ENP is a foreign relations instrument of the European Union EU which seeks to tie those countries to the east and south of the European territory of the EU to the Union. These countries primarily developing countries include some who seek to one day become either a member state of the European Union or more closely integrated with the European Union. The ENP does not apply to neighbours of the EUs outermost regions specifically Frances territories in South America but only to those countries close to EU member states territories in mainland Europe. The countries covered include Algeria Morocco Egypt Israel Jordan Lebanon Libya the Palestinian Authority Syria Tunisia in the South and Armenia Azerbaijan and Belarus Georgia Moldova Ukraine in the East. Russia has a special status with the EU-Russia Common Spaces instead of ENP participation. The EU offers financial assistance to countries within the European Neighbourhood so long as they meet the strict conditions of government reform economic reform and other issues surrounding positive transformation. This process is normally underpinned by an Action Plan as agreed by both Brussels and the target country. The ENP does not cover countries which are in the current EU enlargement agenda the European Free Trade Association or the western European microstates. The EU typically concludes Association Agreements in exchange for commitments to political economic trade or human rights reform in a country. In exchange the country may be offered tariff-free access to some or all EU markets industrial goods agricultural products etc. and financial or technical assistance. ,1

Among the decisions taken at the meeting was a Council decision on the question of qualified majority voting in an enlarged 16-member European Community. The decision was later adjusted in the light of Norway\s decision not to join. The resulting compromise laid down that if members of the Council representing between 23 votes the old blocking minority threshold and 26 votes the new threshold expressed their intention of opposing the taking of a decision by the Council by qualified majority the Council will do all within its power within a reasonable period of time to reach a satisfactory solution that can be adopted by at least 68 votes out of 87. A declaration annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam extended this compromise until the next enlargement took effect. The Ioannina compromise was superseded by the provisions of the Treaty of Nice. It came up again during the negotiations about the Treaty of Lisbon on 21 and 22 June 2007 in Brussels.

The intention was to form a pan-European defence force as an alternative to Germanys proposed accession to NATO meant to harness its military potential in case of conflict with the Soviet bloc. The EDC was to include West Germany France Italy and the Benelux countries. Just as the Schuman Plan was designed to end the risk Germany having the economic power on its own to make war again the Pleven Plan and EDC were meant to prevent the military possibility of Germanys making war again.

132,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Lisbon,For other uses see Treaty of Lisbon disambiguation. The Treaty of Lisbon initially known as the Reform Treaty is an international agreement which amends the two treaties which form the constitutional basis of the European Union EU. The Treaty of Lisbon was signed by the EU member states on 13 December 2007 and entered into force on 1 December 2009. It amends the Maastricht Treaty 1993 known in updated form as the Treaty on European Union 2007 or TEU and the Treaty of Rome 1957 known in updated form as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union 2007 or TFEU. Prominent changes included the move from unanimity to qualified majority voting in at least 45 policy areas in the Council of Ministers a change in calculating such a majority to a new double majority a more powerful European Parliament forming a bicameral legislature alongside the Council of Ministers under the ordinary legislative procedure a consolidated legal personality for the EU and the creation of a long-term President of the European Council and a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The Treaty also made the Union\s bill of rights the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding. The Treaty for the first time gave member states the explicit legal right to leave the EU or rejoin it and procedures to do so. The stated aim of the treaty was to complete the process started by the Treaty of Amsterdam 1997] and by the Treaty of Nice 2001] with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and to improving the coherence of its action. Opponents of the Treaty of Lisbon such as former Danish Member of the European Parliament MEP Jens-Peter Bonde argued that it would centralize the EU and weaken democracy by moving power away from national electorates. Supporters argue that it brings more checks and balances into the EU system with stronger powers for the European Parliament and a new role for national parliaments. Negotiations to modify EU institutions began in 2001 resulting first in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe which would have repealed the existing European treaties and replaced them with a constitution. Although ratified by a majority of member states this was abandoned after being rejected by 54.67% of French voters on 29 May 2005 and then by 61.54% of Dutch voters on 1 June 2005. After a period of reflection member states agreed instead to maintain the existing treaties but to amend them salvaging a number of the reforms that had been envisaged in the constitution. An amending reform treaty was drawn up and signed in Lisbon in 2007. It was originally intended to have been ratified by all member states by the end of 2008. This timetable failed primarily due to the initial rejection of the Treaty in 2008 by the Irish electorate a decision which was reversed in a second referendum in 2009 after Ireland secured a number of concessions related to the treaty. ,1

It amended the Maastricht Treaty or the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty of Rome or the Treaty establishing the European Community which before the Maastricht Treaty was the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community. The Treaty of Nice reformed the institutional structure of the European Union to withstand eastward expansion a task which was originally intended to have been done by the Amsterdam Treaty but failed to be addressed at the time. The entrance into force of the treaty was in doubt for a time after its initial rejection by Irish voters in a referendum in June 2001. This referendum result was reversed in a subsequent referendum held a little over a year later. ,1

It was signed on 25 March 1957 by Belgium France Italy Luxembourg the Netherlands and West Germany and came into force on 1 January 1958. It remains one of the two most important treaties in the modern-day European Union EU. The TEEC proposed the progressive reduction of customs duties and the establishment of a customs union. It proposed to create a single market for goods labour services and capital across the EEC\s member states. It also proposed the creation of common transport and agriculture policies and a European social fund and established the European Commission. Since its signature the treaty\s name has been retrospectively amended on several occasions. The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 removed the word economic from the Treaty of Rome\s official title and in 2009 the Treaty of Lisbon renamed it the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. ,1
135,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Budgetary_treaties_of_the_European_Communities,The Budgetary treaties of the European Communities were two treaties in the 1970s amending the Treaty of Rome in respects to powers over the Community budget. The first treaty signed in 1970 gave the European Parliament the last word on what is known as non-compulsory expenditure compulsory spending is that resulting from EC treaties including agriculture and international agreements; the rest is non-compulsory. The second treaty signed in 1975 gave Parliament the power to reject the budget as a whole and created the European Court of Auditors. However the Council still has the last word on compulsory spending while Parliament has the last word on non-compulsory spending. As a result of these treaties the budgetary authority of what is now the European Union is held jointly by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. Parliament is responsible for discharging the implementation of previous budgets on the basis of the annual report of the European Court of Auditors. It has refused to approve the budget only twice in 1984 and in 1998. On the latter occasion it led to the resignation of the Santer Commission. ,1

It followed the Greenlandic referendum in 1982 in which voters supported exiting the EC. The Treaty arranged for the exit of Greenland and amended earlier treaties of the European Communities. As such it is an integral part of the constitutional basis of the European Union. The decision to withdraw was made after Greenland had achieved self-rule was made to protect Greenlands rights to its fishing waters and to limit external influence.

The term European patent is used to refer to patents granted under the European Patent Convention. However a European patent is not a unitary right but a group of essentially independent nationally-enforceable nationally-revocable patents subject to central revocation or narrowing as a group pursuant to two types of unified post-grant procedures: a time-limited opposition procedure which can be initiated by any person except the patent proprietor and limitation and revocation procedures which can be initiated by the patent proprietor only. The EPC provides a legal framework for the granting of European patents via a single harmonised procedure before the European Patent Office. A single patent application in one language may be filed at the European Patent Office at Munich at its branches at The Hague or Berlin or at a national patent office of a Contracting State if the national law of the State so permits. ,1

The conference of the foreign ministers of the six member states of the European Coal and Steel Community ECSC would lead to the creation of the European Economic Community in 1958. The delegations of the six participating countries were headed by Johan Willem Beyen Netherlands Gaetano Martino Italy Joseph Bech Luxembourg Antoine Pinay France Walter Hallstein Germany and Paul-Henri Spaak Belgium. Joseph Bech was chairman of the meeting. The Foreign Ministers of the ECSC had to meet in order to nominate a member of the High Authority of the ECSC and to appoint its new President and Vice-Presidents for the period expiring on 10 February 1957. The meeting was held at Messina and partially in Taormina at the request of Gaetano Martino the Italian Foreign Minister who was detained in Sicily because of the Regional Assembly elections. They appointed René Mayer as President of the High Authority to replace Jean Monnet. The ministers also reappointed the Belgian Albert Coppé and the German Franz Etzel as Vice-Presidents of the College. In addition to the above-mentioned agenda the meeting included consideration of the action programme to relaunch European integration. In August 1954 the plans had collapsed to create a European Political Community and a common defence force the European Defence Community as a substitute for the national armies of Germany France Italy and the three Benelux countries when France refused to ratify the treaty. The six ECSC countries then turned their attention to the idea of a customs union which was elaborated at Messina. The final resolution of the conference largely reflecting the point of view of the three Benelux countries formed the basis for further work to relaunch European integration. The Benelux countries in their BeNeLux memorandum proposed a revival of European integration on the basis of a common market and integration in the transport and atomic energy sectors. At first the name of Paul van Zeeland former Belgian Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs was mentioned to head the committee which was to work out a proposal. Johan Willem Beyen however proposed Paul-Henri Spaak who was entrusted on 18 June with the production of a report at an Intergovernmental Committee in order to evaluate the option of a sectoral integration or the step-by-step establishment of a European common market. The Spaak Report of the Spaak Committee and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom which was held at the Château of Val-Duchesse would lead to the Treaties of Rome in 1957 and the formation of the European Economic Community and Euratom in 1958. ,1

The treaty came into force on 23 July 1952 and expired on 23 July 2002 exactly fifty years after it came into effect. The treaty was seen as producing diplomatic and economic stability in western Europe after the Second World War. Some of the main enemies during the war were now sharing production of coal and steel the key-resources which previously had been central to the war effort. The Europe Declaration was signed by all the leaders present. It declared that the Treaty had given birth to Europe. It emphasised that the supranational principle was the foundation of the new democratic organisation of Europe. The supranational concept was opposed by Charles de Gaulle. ,1

145,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intergovernmental_Conference,An Intergovernmental Conference IGC is the formal procedure for negotiating amendments to the founding treaties of the European Union. Under the treaties an IGC is called into being by the European Council and is composed of representatives of the member states with the Commission and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating. An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved and final political agreement will be reached. A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification. There was much criticism of the functioning of this process in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice in 2001 especially in regard to the Nice European Council which concluded the IGC. The next IGC due to meet in October 2003 was prepared for by the Convention on the Future of Europe which was modelled after the Convention which negotiated the Charter of Fundamental Rights. One of the recommendations of the Convention is that a convention be used to prepare for future IGCs; this has now indeed been incorporated into the treaty as a requirement for future treaty revisions unless the European Parliament decides that it is not necessary e.g. for minor amendments. The European Council of 21-22 June 2007 delivered to the Portuguese Presidency the mandate to call an IGC. Its objective was to draw up a Treaty amending the existing Treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union as well as the coherence of its external action. The mandate provided the exclusive basis and framework for the work of and defines the timetable for completing this task. This IGC concluded its work on 18 October 2007 presenting the Reform Treaty. ,1

147,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Merger_Treaty,The Merger Treaty or Brussels Treaty was a European treaty which combined the executive bodies of the European Coal and Steel Community ECSC European Atomic Energy Community Euratom and the European Economic Community EEC into a single institutional structure. The treaty was signed in Brussels on 8 April 1965 and came into force on 1 July 1967. It set out that the Commission of the EEC and the Council of the EEC should replace the Commission and Council of Euratom and the High Authority and Council of the ECSC. Although each Community remained legally independent they shared common institutions prior to this treaty they already shared a Parliamentary Assembly and Court of Justice and were together known as the European Communities. This treaty is regarded by some as the real beginning of the modern European Union. This treaty was abrogated by the Amsterdam Treaty signed in 1997: Without prejudice to the paragraphs following hereinafter which have as their purpose to retain the essential elements of their provisions the Convention of 25 March 1957 on certain institutions common to the European Communities and the Treaty of 8 April 1965 establishing a Single Council and a Single Commission of the European Communities but with the exception of the Protocol referred to in paragraph 5 shall be repealed.—\u2009Article 91 of the Amsterdam Treaty ,1

The agreement allows any airline of the European Union and any airline of the United States to fly between any point in the European Union and any point in the United States. Airlines of the United States are also allowed to fly between points in the European Union. Airlines of the European Union are also allowed to fly between the United States and non-EU countries like Switzerland. The treaty disappointed European airlines as it was tilted in favor of United States airlines: while they are allowed to operate intra-EU flights European airlines are not permitted to operate intra-US flights nor are they allowed to purchase a controlling stake in a US operator. The Agreement replaced and superseded previous open skies agreements between the US and individual European countries. The initial agreement was signed in Washington D.C. on April 30 2007. The agreement became effective March 30 2008. Phase two was signed in June 2010. ,1
149,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euro_Plus_Pact,The Euro-Plus Pact or Euro+ Pact also initially called the Competitiveness Pact or later the Pact for the Euro was adopted in March 2011 under EU\s Open Method of Coordination as an intergovernmental agreement between all member states of the European Union except Croatia Czech Republic Hungary Sweden and UK in which concrete commitments were made to be working continuously within a new commonly agreed political general framework for the implementation of structural reforms intended to improve competitiveness employment financial stability and the fiscal strength of each country. The plan was advocated by the French and German governments as one of many needed political responses to strengthen the EMU in areas which the European sovereign-debt crisis had revealed as being too poorly constructed. The pact was constructed as an attempt to incentivize increased implementation of structural reforms by each participating EU member state to improve their performance within the four focus areas of the pact through: 1 A regular bottom-up inter-governmental political dialogue learning best practices from each other and 2 A commitment for each state to include reform measures freely chosen from a broad list of potential policy action responses in their annual National Reform Programme for those of the areas found in critical need of improvement. In addition it also featured a commitment to transpose and operationalize one of the Stability and Growth Pact fiscal rules directly into national legislation - to make it more effectively working and a commitment to perform regular structured dialogue for enhanced tax policy coordination in EU. In May 2015 the European Political Strategy Centre in-house think tank of the European Commission upon its analysis of the latest set of submitted National Reform Programmes declared the pact was in a dormant state not being actively used or referred to by the majority of participating states and recommended it should be revived by moving it from its current intergovernmental state to become an integrated part of the European Semester in the EU framework law. In the latest approved plan for reforming the EMU this recommendation was adopted with a target for its transposition to take place at the latest in June 2017. ,1

151,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euro_convergence_criteria,The euro convergence criteria also known as the Maastricht criteria are the criteria which European Union member states are required to meet to enter the third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union EMU and adopt the euro as their currency. The four main criteria which actually comprise five criteria as the fiscal criterion consist of both a debt criterion and a deficit criterion are based on Article 140 ex article 121.1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Full EMU membership is only open to EU member states. However the European microstates of Andorra Monaco San Marino and the Vatican City which due to their small size are not members of EU have signed monetary agreements with EU which allow them officially to adopt the euro and issue their own variant of euro coins. These states had all previously used one of the eurozone currencies replaced by the euro or a currency pegged to one of them. These states are not members of the eurozone and do not get a seat in the European Central Bank ECB or the Eurogroup. As part of the EU treaty all of the EU Member States are obliged to adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact SGP which as a framework to ensure price stability and fiscal responsibility has adopted identical limits for governments budget deficit and debt as the convergence criteria. Due to the fact that several countries did not exercise a sufficient level of fiscal responsibility during the first 10 years of the euro\s lifetime two major SGP reforms were recently introduced. The first reform was the Sixpack which entered into force in December 2011 and it was followed in January 2013 by the even more ambitious Fiscal Compact which was signed by 25 out of the then-27 EU member states. ,1

153,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement,The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ACTA is a multinational treaty for the purpose of establishing international standards for intellectual property rights enforcement. The agreement aims to establish an international legal framework for targeting counterfeit goods generic medicines and copyright infringement on the Internet and would create a new governing body outside existing forums such as the World Trade Organization the World Intellectual Property Organization and the United Nations. The agreement was signed in October 2011 by Australia Canada Japan Morocco New Zealand Singapore South Korea and the United States. In 2012 Mexico the European Union and 22 countries which are member states of the European Union signed as well. One signatory Japan has ratified formally approved the agreement which would come into force in countries that ratified it after ratification by six countries. Industrial groups with interests in copyright trademarks and other types of intellectual property said that ACTA was a response to the increase in global trade of counterfeit goods and pirated copyright protected works. Organizations such as the Motion Picture Association of America and International Trademark Association are understood to have had a significant influence over the ACTA agenda. Organisations representing citizens and non-governmental interests argued that ACTA could infringe fundamental rights including freedom of expression and privacy. ACTA has also been criticised by Doctors Without Borders for endangering access to medicines in developing countries. The secret nature of negotiations has excluded civil society groups developing countries and the general public from the agreement\s negotiation process and it has been described as policy laundering by critics including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Entertainment Consumers Association. The signature of the EU and many of its member states resulted in widespread protests across Europe. European Parliament rapporteur Kader Arif resigned. His replacement British MEP David Martin recommended that the Parliament should reject ACTA stating: The intended benefits of this international agreement are far outweighed by the potential threats to civil liberties. On 4 July 2012 the European Parliament declined its consent effectively rejecting it 478 votes to 39 with 165 abstentions. ,1
154,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh_Agreement_(1992),The Edinburgh Agreement or Edinburgh Decision is a December 1992 agreement reached at a European Council meeting in Edinburgh Scotland UK that granted Denmark four exceptions to the Maastricht Treaty so that it could be ratified by Denmark. This was necessary because without all member states of the European Union ratifying it it could not come into effect. Denmark had first rejected the Maastricht treaty but with the addition of the Edinburgh Agreement ratified the treaty in a 1993 referendum. The member states that already ratified the Maastricht Treaty did not have to do so again. Denmark obtained four opt-outs from the Maastricht Treaty following the treatys initial rejection in a 1992 referendum. The opt-outs are outlined in the Edinburgh Agreement and concern the EMU as above the Common Security and Defence Policy CSDP Justice and Home Affairs JHA and the citizenship of the European Union. With these opt-outs the Danish people accepted the treaty in a second referendum held in 1993. The EMU opt-out means Denmark is not obliged to participate in the third phase of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism i.e. to replace the Danish krone with the euro. The abolition of the euro opt-out was put to a referendum in 2000 and was rejected. The CSDP opt-out originally meant Denmark would not be obliged to join the Western European Union which originally handled the defence tasks of the EU. Now it means that Denmark does not participate in the European Unions foreign policy where defence is concerned. Hence it does not take part in decisions does not act in that area and does not contribute troops to missions conducted under the auspices of the European Union does not participate in the European Defence Agency. The JHA opt-out exempts Denmark from certain areas of home affairs. Significant parts of these areas were transferred from the third European Union pillar to the first under the Amsterdam Treaty; Denmarks opt-outs from these areas were kept valid through additional protocols so they now have an opt-out from the Area of freedom security and justice. Acts made under those powers are not binding on Denmark except for those relating to Schengen which are instead conducted on an intergovernmental basis with Denmark. Under the Treaty of Lisbon Denmark can change its JHA opt-out from a complete opt-out to the case-by-case opt-in version applying to Ireland and the United Kingdom whenever they wish. The citizenship opt-out stated that European citizenship did not replace national citizenship; this opt-out was rendered meaningless when the Amsterdam Treaty adopted the same wording for all members. The government of Helle Thorning-Schmidt elected in 2011 has said it intends to hold a referendum on ending the opt-outs on Common Security and Defence Policy as well as Justice and Home Affairs. The four exceptions granted to Denmark are as follows: ,1

Article 101 reads 1. The following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the internal market all agreements between undertakings decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention restriction or distortion of competition within the internal market and in particular those which:a directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions;b limit or control production markets technical development or investment;c share markets or sources of supply;d apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage;e make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which by their nature or according to commercial usage have no connection with the subject of such contracts. 2.

Businesses undertakings infringing the provisions of Article 101 are liable to unlimited fines by the European Commission but the EU has no capability to impose prison sentences. Member States should not intervene here as the Commission and the ECJ have the sole authority over EU competition law. However Member States usually have their own domestic competition law which they may enforce provided it is not contrary to EU law.

163,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_Civil_War,The Chinese Civil War was a civil war in China fought between forces loyal to the Kuomintang KMT-led government of the Republic of China and forces loyal to the Communist Party of China CPC. The war began in August 1927 with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek\s Northern Expedition and essentially ended when major active battles ceased in 1950. The conflict eventually resulted in two de facto states the Republic of China ROC in Taiwan and the People\s Republic of China PRC in mainland China both officially claiming to be the legitimate government of China. The war represented an ideological split between the Communist CPC and the KMT\s brand of Nationalism. It continued intermittently until late 1937 when the two parties came together to form the Second United Front to counter a Japanese invasion and prevent the country from adding to an earlier invasion into Manchuria in 1931. China\s full-scale civil war resumed in 1946 a year after the end of hostilities with Japan. Four years later came the cessation of major military hostilities with the newly founded People\s Republic of China controlling mainland China including Hainan and the Republic of China\s jurisdiction being restricted to Taiwan Penghu Quemoy Matsu and several outlying islands. To this day no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed and there is debate about whether the Civil War has legally ended. Cross-Strait relations have been hindered by military threats and political and economic pressure particularly over Taiwan\s political status with both governments officially adhering to a One-China policy. The PRC still actively claims Taiwan as part of its territory and continues to threaten the ROC with a military invasion if the ROC officially declares independence by changing its name to and gaining international recognition as the Republic of Taiwan. The ROC mutually claims mainland China and they both continue the fight over diplomatic recognition. Today the war as such occurs on the political and economic fronts in the form of cross-Strait relations; however the two separate de facto states have close economic ties. ,1
164,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cultural_Revolution,The Cultural Revolution formally the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was a sociopolitical movement that took place in the People\s Republic of China from 1966 until 1976. Set into motion by Mao Zedong then Chairman of the Communist Party of China its stated goal was to preserve \true\ Communist ideology in the country by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society and to re-impose Maoist thought as the dominant ideology within the Party. The Revolution marked the return of Mao Zedong to a position of power after the Great Leap Forward. The movement paralyzed China politically and negatively affected the country\s economy and society to a significant degree. The Revolution was launched in May 1966 after Mao alleged that bourgeois elements had infiltrated the government and society at large aiming to restore capitalism. He insisted that these revisionists be removed through violent class struggle. China\s youth responded to Mao\s appeal by forming Red Guard groups around the country. The movement spread into the military urban workers and the Communist Party leadership itself. It resulted in widespread factional struggles in all walks of life. In the top leadership it led to a mass purge of senior officials most notably Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. During the same period Mao\s personality cult grew to immense proportions. Millions of people were persecuted in the violent struggles that ensued across the country and suffered a wide range of abuses including public humiliation arbitrary imprisonment torture sustained harassment and seizure of property. A large segment of the population was forcibly displaced most notably the transfer of urban youth to rural regions during the Down to the Countryside Movement. Historical relics and artifacts were destroyed. Cultural and religious sites were ransacked. Mao officially declared the Cultural Revolution to have ended in 1969 but its active phase lasted until the death of the military leader Lin Biao in 1971. After Mao\s death and the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976 reformers led by Deng Xiaoping gradually began to dismantle the Maoist policies associated with the Cultural Revolution. In 1981 the Party declared that the Cultural Revolution was responsible for the most severe setback and the heaviest losses suffered by the Party the country and the people since the founding of the People\s Republic. ,1
165,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peasants'_Revolt,The Peasants Revolt also called Wat Tylers Rebellion or the Great Rising was a major uprising across large parts of England in 1381. The revolt had various causes including the socio-economic and political tensions generated by the Black Death in the 1340s the high taxes resulting from the conflict with France during the Hundred Years War and instability within the local leadership of London. The final trigger for the revolt was the intervention of a royal official John Bampton in Essex on 30 May 1381. His attempts to collect unpaid poll taxes in Brentwood ended in a violent confrontation which rapidly spread across the south-east of the country. A wide spectrum of rural society including many local artisans and village officials rose up in protest burning court records and opening the local gaols. The rebels sought a reduction in taxation an end to the system of unfree labour known as serfdom and the removal of the Kings senior officials and law courts. Inspired by the sermons of the radical cleric John Ball and led by Wat Tyler a contingent of Kentish rebels advanced on London. They were met at Blackheath by representatives of the royal government who unsuccessfully attempted to persuade them to return home. King Richard II then aged 14 retreated to the safety of the Tower of London but most of the royal forces were abroad or in northern England. On 13 June the rebels entered London and joined by many local townsfolk attacked the gaols destroyed the Savoy Palace set fire to law books and buildings in the Temple and killed anyone associated with the royal government. The following day Richard met the rebels at Mile End and acceded to most of their demands including the abolition of serfdom. Meanwhile rebels entered the Tower of London killing the Lord Chancellor and the Lord High Treasurer whom they found inside. On 15 June Richard left the city to meet with Tyler and the rebels at Smithfield. Violence broke out and Richards party killed Tyler. Richard defused the tense situation long enough for Londons mayor William Walworth to gather a militia from the city and disperse the rebel forces. Richard immediately began to re-establish order in London and rescinded his previous grants to the rebels. The revolt had also spread into East Anglia where the University of Cambridge was attacked and many royal officials were killed. Unrest continued until the intervention of Henry le Despenser who defeated a rebel army at the Battle of North Walsham on 25 or 26 June. Troubles extended north to York Beverley and Scarborough and as far west as Bridgwater in Somerset. Richard mobilised 4000 soldiers to restore order. Most of the rebel leaders were tracked down and executed; by November at least 1500 rebels had been killed. The Peasants Revolt has been widely studied by academics. Late 19th-century historians used a range of sources from contemporary chroniclers to assemble an account of the uprising and these were supplemented in the 20th century by research using court records and local archives. Interpretations of the revolt have shifted over the years. It was once seen as a defining moment in English history but modern academics are less certain of its impact on subsequent social and economic history. The revolt heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years War by deterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for military campaigns in France. The revolt has been widely used in socialist literature including by the author William Morris and remains a potent political symbol for the political left informing the arguments surrounding the introduction of the Community Charge in the United Kingdom during the 1980s. ,1
166,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Price_revolution,Price revolution is a term used to describe a series of economic events from the second half of the 15th century to the first half of the 17th century. The price revolution refers most specifically to the high rate of inflation that occurred during this period across Western Europe. Prices rose on average roughly sixfold over 150 years. This level of inflation amounts to 1–1.5% per year a relatively low inflation rate for the 20th century standards but rather high given the monetary policy in place in the 16th century. Generally it is thought that this high inflation was caused by the large influx of gold and silver from the Spanish treasure fleet from the New World especially the silver of Bolivia and Mexico which began to be mined in large quantities from 1545 onward. Specie flowed through Spain increasing Spanish prices and then spread over Western Europe as a result of Spanish balance of payments deficit. This enlarged the monetary supply and price levels of many European countries. Combined with this influx of gold and silver the growing population and urbanization perpetuated the price revolution. According to this theory too many people with too much money chased too few goods. ,1
167,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scientific_revolution,The scientific revolution was the emergence of modern science during the early modern period when developments in mathematics physics astronomy biology including human anatomy and chemistry transformed the views of society about nature. The scientific revolution began in Europe towards the end of the Renaissance period and continued through the late 18th century influencing the intellectual social movement known as the Enlightenment. While its dates are disputed the publication in 1543 of Nicolaus Copernicus\s De revolutionibus orbium coelestium On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres is often cited as marking the beginning of the scientific revolution. A first phase of the scientific revolution focused on the recovery of the knowledge of the ancients can be described as the Scientific Renaissance and is considered to have ended in 1632 with publication of Galileo\s Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. The completion of the scientific revolution is attributed to the grand synthesis of Isaac Newton\s 1687 Principia that formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation. By the end of the 18th century the scientific revolution had given way to the Age of Reflection. The concept of a scientific revolution taking place over an extended period emerged in the eighteenth century in the work of Jean Sylvain Bailly who saw a two-stage process of sweeping away the old and establishing the new. ,1

169,http://dbpedia.org/resource/White_Revolution,The White Revolution Persian: انقلاب سفید\u200e\u200e Enghelāb-e Sefid was a far-reaching series of reforms in Iran launched in 1963 by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and lasted until 1978. Mohammad Reza Shah’s reform program was built especially to weaken those classes that supported the traditional system. It consisted of several elements including 1. Land reform 2. Sale of some state-owned factories to finance the land reform 3. Enfranchisement of women 4. Nationalization of forests and pastures 5. Formation of a literacy corps and 6. Institution of profit sharing schemes for workers in industry. The Shaah advertised the White Revolution as a step towards westernization but there is little doubt that he also had political motives; the White Revolution a name attributed to the fact it was bloodless was a way for him to legitimize the Pahlavi dynasty. Part of the reason for launching the White Revolution was that the Shah hoped to get rid of the landlords influence and create a new base of support among the peasants and working class. The bulk of the program was aimed at Iran’s peasantry a class the Shah hoped to gain as an ally to thwart the threat of the increasingly hostile middle class. Thus the White Revolution in Iran represented a new attempt to introduce reform from above and preserve traditional power patterns. Through land reform the essence of the White Revolution the Shah hoped to ally himself with the peasantry in the countryside and hoped to sever their ties with the aristocracy in the city. In order to legitimize the White Revolution the Shah called for a national referendum in early 1963 in which 5598711 people voted for the reforms and 4115 voted against the reforms. What the Shah did not expect was that the White Revolution lead to new social tensions that helped create many of the problems the Shah had been trying to avoid. Land reform instead of allying the peasants with the government produced large numbers of independent farmers and landless laborers who became loose political cannons with no feeling of loyalty to the Shah. As Ervand Abrahamian pointed out The White Revolution had been designed to preempt a Red Revolution. Instead it paved the way for an Islamic Revolution. Though the White Revolution contributed towards the economic and technological advancement of Iran the failures of some of the land reform programs and the partial lack of democratic reforms as well as severe antagonism towards the White Revolution from the clergy and landed elites would ultimately contribute to the Shahs downfall and the Iranian Revolution in 1979. ,1

172,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Balta_Liman,The 1838 Treaty of Balta Limani or the Anglo-Ottoman Treaty is a formal trade agreement signed between the Sublime Porte of the Ottoman Empire and The United Kingdom. The trade policies imposed upon the Ottoman Empire after the Treaty of Balta Limani are considered to be some of the most liberal open market settlements that had ever been enacted during the time. The terms of the treaty stated that the Ottoman Empire will abolish all monopolies allow British merchants and their collaborators to have full access to all Ottoman markets and will be taxed equally to local merchants. These agreements did not constitute an equal free trade arrangement as The United Kingdom still employed protectionist policies on their agricultural markets. Leading up to the Treaty of Balta Limani in the fall of 1831 the Governor of Egypt Mehmet Ali Pasha retaliated against the Ottoman Empire. Mehmet Ali had not been given the territory that Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II had promised him after he showed military expertise in defeating Greek rebels in 1824. In response Ali Pasha’s son Ibrahim Pasha led the Egyptian army to storm Lebanon and Syria quickly defeating Ottoman forces. Mahmud II appealed to Britain and France for help though neither would intervene. Reluctantly the Empire turned to Russia for help which in turn stopped Ali Pasha’s advancements. After a round of negotiations Egypt was able to retain most of the conquered land though neither party was truly satisfied with the outcome. Tensions between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire along with fears of Russian intervention gave the United Kingdom an incentive to negotiate with the Ottomans to gain the upper-hand in trade agreements. The UK took advantage of the unrest and offered its hand in helping the Ottoman Empire defeat Mehmet Ali Pasha in exchange for complete access to Ottoman trade markets. ,1

The rebellion began as a mutiny of sepoys of the East India Companys army on 10 May 1857 in the cantonment of the town of Meerut and soon escalated into other mutinies and civilian rebellions largely in the upper Gangetic plain and central India with the major hostilities confined to present-day Uttar Pradesh western Bihar northern Madhya Pradesh and the Delhi region. The rebellion posed a considerable threat to East India Company power in that region and was contained only with the fall of Gwalior on 20 June 1858. The rebellion has been known by many names including the Indian Mutiny Indias First War of Independence the Great Rebellion the Indian Rebellion the Revolt of 1857 the Rebellion of 1857 the Uprising of 1857 the Sepoy Rebellion the Indian Insurrection and the Sepoy Mutiny. Other regions of Company-controlled India such as the Bengal division of Bengal Presidency comprising present-day Bangladesh West Bengal Odisha Bihar and Jharkhand the Bombay Presidency and the Madras Presidency remained largely calm except for Bihar which experienced multiple disturbances in the Shahabad region where the revolt was led by Kunwar Singh. In Punjab the Sikh princes backed the Company by providing soldiers and support. The large princely states of Hyderabad Mysore Travancore and Kashmir as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana did not join the rebellion. In some regions such as Oudh the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against European presence. Some rebel leaders such as Lakshmibai the Rani of Jhansi became folk heroes in the nationalist movement in India half a century later. The rebellion led to the dissolution of the East India Company in 1858. It also led the British to reorganise the army the financial system and the administration in India. The country was thereafter directly governed by the crown as the new British Raj. ,1

178,http://dbpedia.org/resource/July_Ordinances,July Ordinances also known as the Four Ordinances of Saint-Cloud were a series of decrees set forth by Charles X and Jules Armand de Polignac the chief minister in July 1830. Compelled by what he felt to be a growing manipulative radicalism in the elected government Charles felt that as king by right of birth his primary duty was the guarantee of order and happiness in France and its people; not in political bipartisanship and the self-interpreted rights of implacable political enemies. The result was that on 9 July 1830 Charles announced that in his interpretation of and in full compliance with Article 14 of the Charte he would henceforth govern by ordonnances. On 25 July while a guest at Saint-Cloud he signed the famous July Ordinances which were published in the Parisian newspaper Moniteur the following day. These ordinances of 26 July: \n*  Suspended the liberty of the press \n*  Appointed new and what many considered reactionary Conseillers d\Etat \n*  Dissolved the newly elected Chamber of Deputies of France \n*  Reduced the number of deputies in future Chambers \n*  Summoned new electoral colleges for September of that year \n*  Withdrew the Deputies\ right of amendment \n*  Excluded the commercial middle-class from future elections It was intended to quell the people of France. However the ordinances had the opposite effect of angering the French citizens. Journalists gathered in protest at the headquarters of the National daily founded in January 1830 by Adolphe Thiers Armand Carrel and others. The final result was the July Revolution and Charles X\s abdication and exile. ,1
179,http://dbpedia.org/resource/May_Revolution,The May Revolution Spanish: Revolución de Mayo was a week-long series of events that took place from May 18 to 25 1810 in Buenos Aires capital of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. This Spanish colony included roughly the territories of present-day Argentina Bolivia Paraguay and Uruguay. The result was the removal of Viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros and the establishment of a local government the Primera Junta First Junta on May 25. It was the first successful revolution in South American Independence process. The May Revolution was a direct reaction to Spains Peninsular War. In 1808 King Ferdinand VII of Spain abdicated in favor of Napoleon who granted the throne to his brother Joseph Bonaparte. A Supreme Central Junta led resistance to Josephs government and the French occupation of Spain but eventually suffered a series of reversals that resulted in the Spanish loss of the northern half of the country. On February 1 1810 French troops took Seville and gained control of most of Andalusia. The Supreme Junta retreated to Cadiz and dissolved itself and the Council of Regency of Spain and the Indies replaced it. News of these events arrived in Buenos Aires on May 18 brought by British ships. Viceroy Cisneros tried to maintain the political status quo but a group of criollo lawyers and military officials organized an open cabildo a special meeting of notables of the city on May 22 to decide the future of the Viceroyalty. Delegates denied recognition to the Council of Regency in Spain and established a junta to govern in place of Cisneros since the government that had appointed him Viceroy no longer existed. To maintain a sense of continuity Cisneros was initially appointed president of the Junta. However this caused much popular unrest so he resigned under pressure on May 25. The newly formed government the Primera Junta included only representatives from Buenos Aires and invited other cities of the Viceroyalty to send delegates to join them. This resulted in the outbreak of war between the regions that accepted the outcome of the events at Buenos Aires and those that did not. The May Revolution began the Argentine War of Independence although no formal declaration of independence was issued at the time and the Primera Junta continued to govern in the name of the deposed king Ferdinand VII. As similar events occurred in many other cities of the continent the May Revolution is also considered one of the early events of the Spanish American wars of independence. Historians today debate whether the revolutionaries were truly loyal to the Spanish crown or whether the declaration of fidelity to the king was a necessary ruse to conceal the true objective—to achieve independence—from a population that was not yet ready to accept such a radical change. A formal declaration of independence was finally issued at the Congress of Tucumán on July 9 1816. ,1

184,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pernambucan_Revolt,The Pernambucan Revolt of 1817 occurred in the province of Pernambuco in the Northeastern region of Brazil and was sparked mainly by the decline of sugar cane production and the influence of the Freemasonry in the region. Other important reasons for the revolt include: the ongoing struggle for the independence of Spanish colonies in South America; the independence of the United States; the generally liberal ideas that came through all of Brazil the century before including many French Enlightenment Philosophers such as Charles Montesquieu and Jean-Jacques Rousseau; the actions of secret societies which insisted on the liberation of the colony; the development of a distinct culture in Pernambuco. The movement was led by Domingos José Martins with the support of Antônio Carlos de Andrada e Silva and Frei Caneca. Although a republic was declared there were no measures adopted to abolish slavery. The Consulate General of the United States in Recife American’s oldest diplomatic post in the Southern Hemisphere publicly supported the Pernambucan revolutionaries.

186,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Technological_revolution,Technological revolution is in general a relatively short period in history when one technology or better a set of technologies is replaced by another technology or by the set of technologies. As Nick Bostrom wrote: “We might define a technological revolution as a dramatic change brought about relatively quickly by the introduction of some new technology.”  It is an era of an accelerated technological progress characterized not only by new innovations but also their application and diffusion. A difference between technological revolution and technological change is not clearly defined.The technological change we could see as an introduction of an individual single new technology while the technological revolution as a period in which more new technologies are adopted at the almost same time. These new technologies or technological changes are usually interconnected - as 3rd Kranzberg\s law of technology says: Technology comes in packages big and small. ,1
187,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mau_Mau_Uprising,The Mau Mau Uprising also known as the Mau Mau Rebellion Mau Mau Revolt or Kenya Emergency was a military conflict that took place in British Kenya between 1952 and 1960. It involved Kikuyu-dominated groups summarily called Mau Mau the white settlers and elements of the British Army including local Kenya Regiment mostly consisting of the British auxiliaries and anti-Mau Mau Kikuyu. The capture of rebel leader Dedan Kimathi on 21 October 1956 signalled the ultimate defeat of the Mau Mau and essentially ended the British military campaign. The Mau Mau failed to capture widespread public support partly due to the British policy of divide and rule and the movement remained internally divided despite attempts to unify its various strands. The British meanwhile could draw upon their ongoing efforts to put down another rebellion in Malaya. The uprising created a rift between the European colonial community in Kenya and the metropole but also resulted in violent divisions within the Kikuyu community. The financial cost of the uprising to the former colony amounted to £55 million. On 12 September 2015 the British Government unveiled a Mau Mau memorial statue in Nairobi\s Uhuru Park that it had funded as a symbol of reconciliation between the British government the Mau Mau and all those who suffered. This followed a June 2013 decision by Britain to compensate more than 5000 Kenyans tortured and abused during the Mau Mau insurgency. ,1
188,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quiet_Revolution,The Quiet Revolution French: Révolution tranquille was a period of intense socio-political and socio-cultural change in the Canadian province of Québec characterized by the effective secularization of society the creation of a welfare state état-providence and realignment of politics into federalist and sovereignist factions and the eventual election of a pro-sovereignty provincial government in the 1976 election. The Quiet Revolution typically refers to the efforts made by the Liberal governments of Jean Lesage elected in 1960 and Robert Bourassa elected in 1970 though given the profound effect of the changes most provincial governments since the early 1960s have maintained an orientation based on core concepts developed and implemented in that era. A primary change was an effort by the provincial government to take more direct control over the fields of health care and education which had previously been in the hands of the Roman Catholic Church. It created ministries of Health and Education expanded the public service and made massive investments in the public education system and provincial infrastructure. The government further allowed unionization of the civil service. It took measures to increase Québécois control over the provinces economy and nationalized electricity production and distribution and worked to establish the Canada/Quebec Pension Plan. The Quiet Revolution was a period of unbridled economic and social development in Quebec and Canada and paralleled similar developments in the West in general. It was a byproduct of Canadas 20-year post-war expansion and Quebecs position as the leading province for more than a century before and after Confederation. It witnessed particular changes to the built environment and social structures of Montreal Quebecs leading city. The Quiet Revolution also extended beyond Quebecs borders by virtue of its influence on contemporary Canadian politics. During the same era of renewed Quebecois nationalism French Canadians made great inroads into both the structure and direction of the federal government and national policy. Moreover certain facets of the welfare state as they developed in Quebec in the 1960s became nationalized by virtue of Quebecs acceptance and promotion. This would include rural electrification and healthcare initiatives undertaken by Tommy Douglas in Saskatchewan twenty years earlier. ,1
189,http://dbpedia.org/resource/May_Days,The May Days of 1937 sometimes also called May Events refer to a series of clashes between 3 and 8 May 1937 were a period of civil violence in Catalonia when factions on the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War engaged each other in street battles in various parts of Catalonia and centered on the city of Barcelona in the context of the Spanish Civil War. In these events the supporters of the Spanish Revolution were outmanoeuvred by the recently expropriated bourgeoisie represented by the Comintern-affiliated P.S.U.C. Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia and Catalan nationalists. It would however lead to the latter surrendering Catalan autonomy to the central government a major factor in the collapse of the front before the Nationalist invasion the following year. It was a major turning point in the confrontation between the interests of foreign capital especially Britain and France supported by the Soviet Union and the Spanish Revolution which had been the fatal faultline in the Spanish Republic. All these powers were essentially hedging their bets with regard to fascism as none wanted to take on Germany and Italy directly. For Stalin especially the Spanish conflict was a holding pattern to be prolonged until the fascists threatened the British Empire directly. His popular front policy of courting \progressive bourgeois parties\ in stark contrast to the \class against class\ position of the nineteen twenties was threatened by events in Spain which had been sliding inexorably into all out class war for thirty years with regular spontaneous insurrections. Most Spaniards lived on the brink of starvation and were tired of waiting for reform the coup had been preceded by a wave of land expropriations and general strikes. The impotence of the popular front government and the revolt of the military had removed any basis for legitimate authority and a profound social revolution was in full swing with workers and peasants spontaneously organising themselves according to the principles of libertarian communism. The Soviets were determined to prevent this at all costs so they began by engineering a coup against the working class in Catalonia. Their immediate objective was to destabilise the Socialist government of Largo Caballero who was regarded by his followers as the \Spanish Lenin\ using the right wing of his own party against him. They had chosen as his successor the right-wing social democrat finance minister Juan Negrin who was much more in tune with Russian foreign policy. This would allow them to eliminate dissident i.e. non-Comintern Marxists from positions of responsibility and as a bonus end Catalan autonomy the better to attack the anarchosyndicalists. “Long before the first shot was discharged in Barcelona English and French cruisers were hurrying toward the port as if they had a prophetic presentiment of the things to come. If one takes all this into consideration one asks oneself how much faith in the triumph of the anti-Fascist cause still exists among those people who invoke foreign protection against the workers of their own country? - Diego Abad de Santillan Solidaridad Obrera May 13 1937. ,1

Among the members were writers teachers students minor government officials and army officers. While differing in political views most of them were opponents of the tsarist autocracy and Russian serfdom. Like that of the Lyubomudry group founded earlier in the century the purpose of the circle was to discuss Western philosophy and literature that was officially banned by the Imperial government of Nicholas I.Among those connected to the circle were the writers Dostoyevsky and Saltykov-Shchedrin and the poets Aleksey Pleshcheyev Apollon Maikov and Taras Shevchenko. Nicholas I alarmed at the prospect of the revolutions of 1848 spreading to Russia saw great danger in organisations like the Petrashevsky Circle. In 1849 members of the Circle were arrested and imprisoned. A large group of prisoners Dostoyevsky among them were sent to Semyonov Place for execution. As they stood in the square waiting to be shot a messenger interrupted the proceedings with notice of a reprieve. As part of a pre-planned intentional deception the Tsar had prepared a letter to general-adjutant Sumarokov commuting the death sentences to incarceration. Some of the prisoners were sent to Siberia others to prisons. Dostoyevskys eight-year sentence was later reduced to four years by Nicholas I. ,1

196,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petroleum_Revolution,The Petroleum Revolution Valencian: La Revolució del Petroli was a workers revolt of a libertarian and syndicalist nature which took place in Alcoy Alicante Spain in 1873. During the First Spanish Republic Alcoy was one of the few Spanish cities where the Industrial Revolution had taken root. The city was occupied by the paper textile and metallurgic industries which had engendred a great upswing in population and the implementation of a capitalist system of production as well as introducing mechanisation as a substitute for much former manual labour. This provoked the appearance of Luddite movements which began to destroy the machinery in vindication and defense of the working class. This situation placed the city of Alcoy at the frontlines of the social conflicts of this era due to the poor situation of the workers who organised themselves and were pioneers in the establishment of the First Workers International AIT in Spain. Other proletarian revolutions arose in Spain but the most significant was Petroleum Revolution. In that event the workers seized control of the city for days in July 1873 in the course of a general strike which eventually became a riot against the republican mayor Agustí Albors better known as Pelletes. During the revolt Albors gave the order to fire on demonstrators who defended themselves by assaulting the town hall and executing the mayor and trapping the rest of the municipal leadership in the building. The city declared itself independent and was governed from 9–13 July 1873 by the Committee of Public Health presided over by Severino Albarracín. The demonstrators declared a series of pay raises and reducing the work day. Finally the revolt ended with the intervention of the federal army and the military occupation of the city hefty repression against the revolutionaries and practically no improvements for the labouring class. More than 600 workers were put on trial including minors between 12 and 17 years of age. Many of the accused were condemned to death. Those events broke the collaboration agreements between the republicans and anarchists and gave the Marxists room to criticise the anarchists directing the workers movement. Friedrich Engels himself put grim criticism in his 1873 mémoir on the bakunists role in the Spanish uprising. After that point the working class began to self-organise aided by certain factors of the Catholic Church. They created various organisations and institutions: professional Catholic schools known as Salesianos Catholic workers clubs and savings funds like the Monte de Piedad 1875. The event is called the Petroleum Revolution since the workers desperate due to living conditions carried as their standard petroleum-soaked torches. During those days according to chroniclers the city stank of petroleum. ,1

Though the Sherifian revolt has tended to be regarded as a revolt rooted in a secular Arab nationalist sentiment the Sherif did not present it in those terms; rather he accused the Young Turks of violating the sacred tenets of Islam and called Arab Muslims to sacred rebellion against the ostensibly impious Ottoman government. Contrarily Turks accuse rebelling tribes for betraying the Muslim Caliphate during his campaign against imperialist powers which were trying to divide and govern the Muslim lands. ,1

The Greek campaign was launched primarily because the western Allies particularly British Prime Minister David Lloyd George had promised Greece territorial gains at the expense of the Ottoman Empire recently defeated in World War I. The armed conflict started when the Greek forces landed in Smyrna now Izmir on 15 May 1919. They advanced inland and took control of the western and northwestern part of Anatolia including the cities of Manisa Balıkesir Aydın Kütahya Bursa and Eskişehir. Their advance was checked at the Battle of Sakarya in 1921 by forces of the Turkish national movement. The Greek front collapsed with the Turkish counter-attack in August 1922 and the war effectively ended with the Great Fire of Smyrna by the Turkish forces. As a result the Greek government accepted the demands of the Turkish national movement and returned to its pre-war borders thus leaving East Thrace and Western Anatolia to Turkey. The Allies abandoned the Treaty of Sèvres to negotiate a new treaty at Lausanne with the Turkish National Movement. The Treaty of Lausanne recognized the independence of the Republic of Turkey and its sovereignty over Asia Minor Constantinople and Eastern Thrace. Greek and Turkish governments agreed to engage in a population exchange. ,1

It impacted the institution of slavery throughout the Americas. Self-liberated slaves destroyed slavery at home fought to preserve their freedom and with the collaboration of mulattoes founded the sovereign state of Haiti. It led to the greatest slave uprising since Spartacus who led an unsuccessful revolt against the Roman Republic nearly 1900 years prior. The Haitian Revolution was the only slave uprising that led to the founding of a state free from slavery and ruled by non-whites and former captives. With the increasing number of Haitian Revolutionary Studies in the last few decades it has become clear that the event was a defining moment in the racial histories of the Atlantic World. The legacy of the Revolution was that it challenged long-held beliefs about black inferiority and of the enslaved persons capacity to achieve and maintain freedom. The rebels organizational capacity and tenacity under pressure became the source of stories that shocked and frightened slave owners. ,1

Led by Stepan Petrichenko and consisting of Russian sailors soldiers and civilians the rebellion was one of the reasons for Vladimir Lenins and the Communist Partys decision to loosen its control of the Russian economy by implementing the New Economic Policy NEP. The rebellion originated in Kronstadt a naval fortress on Kotlin Island in the Gulf of Finland that served as the base of the Russian Baltic Fleet and as a guardpost for the approaches to Petrograd 55 kilometres 34 mi away.

There was a sustained campaign of civil resistance against regime violence and electoral fraud. The nonviolent revolution led to the departure of President Ferdinand Marcos and the restoration of democracy in the Philippines. It is also referred to as the Yellow Revolution due to the presence of yellow ribbons during the demonstrations following the assassination of Filipino senator Benigno Aquino Jr. It was widely seen as a victory of the people against the 20-year running authoritarian repressive regime of then president Ferdinand Marcos and made news headlines as the revolution that surprised the world. The majority of the demonstrations took place on a long stretch of Epifanio de los Santos Avenue more commonly known by its acronym EDSA in Metro Manila from February 22–25 1986. They involved over two million Filipino civilians as well as several political and military groups and religious groups led by Cardinal Jaime Sin the Archbishop of Manila and the CBCP President Cardinal Ricardo Vidal the Archbishop of Cebu. The protests fueled by the resistance and opposition from years of corrupt governance by Marcos culminated with the departure of the dictator from Malacañang Palace to Hawaii. Corazon Aquino was proclaimed as the President of the Philippines after the revolution. ,1
204,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Second_Industrial_Revolution,The Second Industrial Revolution also known as the Technological Revolution was a phase of rapid industrialization in the finalthird of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. The First Industrial Revolution which ended in the early-mid 1800s was punctuated by a slowdown in macroinventions before the Second Industrial Revolution in 1870. Though a number of its characteristic events can be traced to earlier innovations in manufacturing such as the establishment of a machine tool industry the development of methods for manufacturing interchangeable parts and the invention of the Bessemer Process the Second Industrial Revolution is generally dated between 1870 and 1914 up to the start of World War I. Advancements in manufacturing and production technology enabled the widespread adoption of preexisting technological systems such as telegraph and railroad networks gas and water supply and sewage systems which had earlier been concentrated to a few select cities. The enormous expansion of rail and telegraph lines after 1870 allowed unprecedented movement of people and ideas which culminated in a new wave of globalization. In the same period new systems were introduced most significantly electrical power and telephones. The Second Industrial Revolution continued into the 20th century with early factory electrification and the production line and ended at the start of the First World War. ,1

It began with the dissatisfaction of the handling of a railway crisis. The crisis then escalated to an uprising where the revolutionaries went up against Qing government officials. The uprising was then assisted by the New Army in a coup against their own authorities in the city of Wuchang Hubei province on October 10 1911. The Battle of Yangxia led by Huang Xing would be the major engagement in the uprising. ,1
206,http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Serbian_Uprising,The First Serbian Uprising Serbian: Први српски устанак Prvi srpski ustanak was an uprising of Serbs in the Sanjak of Smederevo against the Ottoman Empire from 14 February 1804 to 7 October 1813. Initially a local revolt against renegade janissaries who had seized power through a coup it evolved into a war for independence the Serbian Revolution after more than three centuries of Ottoman rule and short-lasting Austrian occupations. The dahije janissary commanders murdered the Ottoman Vizier in 1801 and occupied the sanjak ruling it independently from the Sultan. Tyranny ensued; the janissaries suspended the rights granted to Serbs by the Sultan earlier and increased taxes and imposed forced labor among other things. In 1804 the janissaries feared that the Sultan would use the Serbs against them so they murdered many Serbian chiefs. Enraged an assembly chose Karađorđe as leader of the uprising and the rebel army quickly defeated and took over towns throughout the sanjak technically fighting for the Sultan. The Sultan fearing their power ordered all pashaliks in the region to crush them. The Serbs marched against the Ottomans and after major victories in 1805–06 established a government and parliament that returned the land to the people abolished forced labor and reduced taxes. Military success continued over the years; however there was dissent between Karađorđe and other leaders—Karađorđe wanted absolute power while his dukes some of whom abused their privileges for personal gain wanted to limit it. After the Russo-Turkish War ended and Russian support ceased the Ottoman Empire exploited these circumstances and reconquered Serbia in 1813. Although the uprising was crushed it was continued by the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815 which resulted in the creation of the Principality of Serbia as it gained semi-independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1817 formally in 1829. ,1

It began with a military insurrection in the city of Porto in northern Portugal that quickly and peacefully spread to the rest of the country. The Revolution resulted in the return in 1821 of the Portuguese Court to Portugal from Brazil where it had fled during the Peninsular War and initiated a constitutional period in which the 1822 Constitution was ratified and implemented. The movements liberal ideas had an important influence on Portuguese society and political organization in the nineteenth century. ,1

The occupation was enforced following the defeat of the First Serbian Uprising 1804–1813 during which Serbia existed as a de facto independent state for over a decade. The second revolution ultimately resulted in Serbian semi-independence from the Ottoman Empire. The Principality of Serbia was established governed by its own parliament constitution and royal dynasty. De jure independence followed during the second half of the 19th century. ,1
209,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tuareg_rebellion_(1962–64),The Tuareg rebellion of 1962–1964 sometimes called the First Tuareg Rebellion or the Alfellaga was a short lived insurgency by populations of what is now northern Mali begun shortly after the nation achieved independence from France in 1960. Many in the sparsely populated and ethnically distinct north of Mali along with some in southern Algeria and northern Niger expected an independent Tuareg Berber and Arab nation to be formed by the Sahara desert regions when French Colonialism ended. This combined with dissatisfaction over the new government led some Tuareg in Northern Mali to rebel in 1963. This rebellion was short-lived as the military response of the new Malian government was swift and harsh. No more than 1500 anti-government fighters were ever active following the larger rising on 1963 but the response of the Malian Armed Forces occupying much of what is now Kidal region Gao Region and Tomboctou Region resulted in a refugee crisis as thousands fled to what is now Algeria the southern reaches of which were still under French control. The military occupation deaths torture and imprisonment of suspected rebels has left deep resentment in much of the northern population. The area has seen three successive major rebellions in the decades since and remains a source of conflict. ,1
210,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tuareg_rebellion_(1990–95),From 1990 to 1995 a rebellion by various Tuareg groups took place in Niger and Mali with the aim of achieving autonomy or forming their own nation-state. The insurgency occurred in a period following the regional famine of the 1980s and subsequent refugee crisis and a time of generalised political repression and crisis in both nations. The conflict is one in a series of Tuareg-based insurgencies in the colonial and post-colonial history of these nations. In Niger it is also referred to as the Second or Third Tuareg Rebellion a reference to the pre-independence rebellions of Ag Mohammed Wau Teguidda Kaocen of the Aïr Mountains in 1914 Kaocen Revolt and the rising of Firhoun of Ikazkazan in 1911 who reappeared in Mali in 1916. In fact the nomadic Tuareg confederations have come into sporadic conflict with the sedentary communities of the region ever since they migrated from the Maghreb between the 7th and 14th centuries CE. Some but not all Tuareg wished for an independent Tuareg Nation to be formed when French Colonialism ended. This combined with dissatisfaction over the new governments led some Tuareg in Northern Mali to rebel in 1963. This rebellion was short-lived as the military response of the new Malian government was swift and harsh. ,1
211,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1973_Chilean_coup_d'état,The 1973 Chilean coup détat was a watershed event in both the history of Chile and the Cold War. Following an extended period of social unrest and political tension between the right-dominated Congress of Chile and the elected socialist President Salvador Allende as well as economic warfare ordered by US President Richard Nixon Allende was overthrown by the armed forces and national police. The military deposed Allendes Popular Unity government and later established a junta that suspended all political activity in Chile and repressed left-wing movements especially the communist and socialist parties and the Revolutionary Left Movement MIR. Allendes appointed army chief Augusto Pinochet rose to supreme power within a year of the coup formally assuming power in late 1974. The United States government which had worked to create the conditions for the coup promptly recognized the junta government and supported it in consolidating power. During the air raids and ground attacks that preceded the coup Allende gave his last speech in which he vowed to stay in the presidential palace refusing offers of safe passage should he choose exile over confrontation. Direct witness accounts of Allendes death agree that he killed himself in the palace. Before the coup Chile had for decades been hailed as a beacon of democracy and political stability while the rest of South America had been plagued by military juntas and Caudillismo. The collapse of Chilean democracy ended a streak of democratic governments in Chile which had held democratic elections since 1932. Historian Peter Winn characterized the 1973 coup as one of the most violent events in Chiles history. A weak insurgent movement against the Pinochet regime was maintained inside Chile by elements sympathetic to the former Allende government. An internationally supported plebiscite in 1988 eventually removed Pinochet from power. ,1

213,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neolithic_Revolution,The Neolithic Revolution or Neolithic Demographic Transition sometimes called the Agricultural Revolution was the wide-scale transition of many human cultures from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to one of agriculture and settlement allowing the ability to handle an increasingly larger population. These settled communities permitted humans to observe and experiment with plants to learn how they grew and developed. This new knowledge led to the domestication of plants. Archaeological data indicates that the domestication of various types of plants and animals evolved in separate locations worldwide starting in the geological epoch of the Holocene around 12500 years ago. It was the world\s first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture. The Neolithic Revolution greatly narrowed the diversity of foods available with a switch to agriculture which led to a downturn in human nutrition. The Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a limited set of food-producing techniques. During the next millennia it would transform the small and mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that had hitherto dominated human pre-history into sedentary non-nomadic societies based in built-up villages and towns. These societies radically modified their natural environment by means of specialized food-crop cultivation e.g. irrigation and deforestation which allowed extensive surplus food production. These developments provided the basis for densely populated settlements specialization and division of labour trading economies the development of non-portable art and architecture centralized administrations and political structures hierarchical ideologies depersonalized systems of knowledge e.g. writing and property ownership. Personal land and private property ownership led to hierarchical society an elite Social class comprising a nobility polity and military. The first fully developed manifestation of the entire Neolithic complex is seen in the Middle Eastern Sumerian cities c.\u20095500 BP whose emergence also heralded the beginning of the Bronze Age. The relationship of the above-mentioned Neolithic characteristics to the onset of agriculture their sequence of emergence and empirical relation to each other at various Neolithic sites remains the subject of academic debate and varies from place to place rather than being the outcome of universal laws of social evolution. The Levant followed by Mesopotamia are the sites of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10000 BC. It has been identified as having inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the wheel the planting of the first cereal crops and the development of cursive script mathematics astronomy and agriculture. ,1
214,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rose_Revolution,The Revolution of Roses often translated into English as the Rose Revolution Georgian: ვარდების რევოლუცია vardebis revolutsia describes a pro-Western peaceful change of power in Georgia in November 2003. The revolution was brought about by widespread protests over the disputed parliamentary elections and culminated in the ouster of President Eduard Shevardnadze which marked the end of the Soviet era of leadership in the country. The event derives its name from the climactic moment when demonstrators led by Mikheil Saakashvili stormed the Parliament session with red roses in hand. Consisting of twenty days worth of protests the Revolution triggered new presidential and parliamentary elections in Georgia which established the United National Movement as the dominant ruling party. Following the Rose Revolution Georgia pursued a decidedly pro-Western foreign policy and declared European and Euro-Atlantic integration as its main priority; this change in trajectory contributed to Georgias tensions with Russia which continue to this day. ,1
215,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salt_March,The Salt March also known as the Dandi March and the Dandi Satyagraha was an act of nonviolent civil disobedience in colonial India initiated by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi to produce salt from the seawater in the coastal village of Dandi as was the practice of the local populace until British officials introduced taxation on salt production deemed their sea-salt reclamation activities illegal and then repeatedly used force to stop it. The 24-day march began on 12 March 1930 as a direct action campaign of tax resistance and nonviolent protest against the British salt monopoly and it gained worldwide attention which gave impetus to the Indian independence movement and started the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement. The march was the most significant organised challenge to British authority since the Non-cooperation movement of 1920–22 and directly followed the Purna Swaraj declaration of sovereignty and self-rule by the Indian National Congress on 26 January 1930. Gandhi led the Dandi March from his base Sabarmati Ashram near the city of Ahmedabad. 78 people began the march with Gandhi who intended to walk 240 miles 390 km to the coastal village of Dandi which was located at a small town called Navsari in the state of Gujarat. As Gandhi and the others continued on what would become a 24-day march to Dandi to produce salt without paying the tax growing numbers of Indians joined them along the way. When Gandhi broke the salt laws at 6:30 am on 6 April 1930 it sparked large scale acts of civil disobedience against the British Raj salt laws by millions of Indians. The campaign had a significant effect on changing world and British attitudes towards Indian sovereignty and self-rule  and caused large numbers of Indians to join the fight for the first time. After making salt at Dandi Gandhi continued southward along the coast producing salt and addressing meetings on the way. The Congress Party planned to stage a satyagraha at the Dharasana Salt Works 25 miles south of Dandi. However Gandhi was arrested on the midnight of 4–5 May 1930 just days before the planned action at Dharasana. The Dandi March and the ensuing Dharasana Satyagraha drew worldwide attention to the Indian independence movement through extensive newspaper and newsreel coverage. The satyagraha against the salt tax continued for almost a year ending with Gandhi\s release from jail and negotiations with Viceroy Lord Irwin at the Second Round Table Conference. Over 80000 Indians were jailed as a result of the Salt Satyagraha. However it failed to result in major concessions from the British. The Salt Satyagraha campaign was based upon Gandhi\s principles of nonviolent protest called satyagraha which he loosely translated as truth-force or truthful demand. Literally it is formed from the Sanskrit words satya truth and agraha insistence. In early 1930 the Indian National Congress chose satyagraha as their main tactic for winning Indian sovereignty and self-rule from British rule and appointed Gandhi to organise the campaign. Gandhi chose the 1882 British Salt Act as the first target of satyagraha. The Salt March to Dandi and the beating by British police of hundreds of nonviolent protesters in Dharasana which received worldwide news coverage demonstrated the effective use of civil disobedience as a technique for fighting social and political injustice. The satyagraha teachings of Gandhi and the March to Dandi had a significant influence on American activists Martin Luther King Jr. James Bevel and others during the movement for civil rights for blacks and other minority groups in the 1960s. ,1

Both Saddam Hussein later President of Iraq and Salah Omar al-Ali later a Ba\athist dissident were major participants in the coup. According to historian Charles R. H. Tripp the coup upset the US-sponsored security system established as part of the Cold War in the Middle East. It appeared that any enemy of the Baghdad regime was a potential ally of the United States. The Ba\ath Party ruled from the 17 July Revolution until 2003 when it was removed from power by an invasion led by American and British forces. Iraq then came under a military occupation by a multinational coalition. The 17 July Revolution is not to be confused with the 14 July Revolution a coup on 14 July 1958 when King Faisal II was overthrown ending the Hashemite dynasty in Iraq and establishing the Republic of Iraq. ,1

Subsequently a guerrilla liberation war was fought against the Axis occupying forces and their locally established puppet regimes including the Independent State of Croatia and the Government of National Salvation in Serbia by the Communist-led republican Yugoslav Partisans. Simultaneously a multi-side civil war was waged between the Partisans the Serbian royalist Chetniks Croatian nationalist Ustaše and Home Guard as well as Slovene Home Guard troops. Both the Yugoslav Partisans and the Chetnik movement initially resisted the occupation. However after 1941 Chetniks extensively and systematically collaborated with the Italian occupation forces until the Italian capitulation and thereon also with German and Ustaše forces. The Axis mounted a series of offensives intended to destroy the Partisans coming close to doing so in winter and spring of 1943. Despite the setbacks the Partisans remained a credible fighting force gaining recognition from the Western Allies and laying the foundations for the post-war Yugoslav state. With support in logistics and air power from the Western Allies and Soviet ground troops in the Belgrade Offensive the Partisans eventually gained control of the entire country and of border regions of Italy and Austria. The human cost of the war was enormous. The number of war victims is still in dispute but is generally agreed to have been at least one million. Non-combat victims included the majority of the country\s Jewish population many of whom perished in concentration and extermination camps e.g. Jasenovac Banjica run by the client regimes. The Croatian Ustaše regime committed genocide against local Serbs Jews and Roma. The Chetniks pursued ethnic cleansing against Muslims and Croats and the Italian occupation authorities pursued against Slovenes. Partisans carried terror and executions against families of Chetnik fighters and Class enemies. German troops carried out mass executions of civilians in retaliation for resistance activity Kragujevac massacre. Finally during and after the final stages of the war Yugoslav authorities and Partisan troops carried out reprisals including the deportation of the Danube Swabian population forced marches and executions of thousands of captured collaborators and civilians fleeing their advance Bleiburg repatriations atrocities against the Italian population in Istria Foibe massacres and purges against Serbs Hungarians and Germans associated with the fascist forces. ,1

Approximately two million people joined their hands to form a human chain spanning 675.5 kilometres 419.7 mi across the three Baltic states – Estonia Latvia and Lithuania considered at the time to be constituent republics of the Soviet Union. The demonstration originated in Black Ribbon Day protests held in the western cities in the 1980s. It marked the 50th anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The pact and its secret protocols divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence and led to the occupation of the Baltic states in 1940. The event was organised by Baltic pro-independence movements: Rahvarinne of Estonia the Tautas fronte of Latvia and Sąjūdis of Lithuania. The protest was designed to draw global attention by demonstrating a popular desire for independence for each of the entities. It also illustrated solidarity among the three nations. It has been described as an effective publicity campaign and an emotionally captivating and visually stunning scene. The event presented an opportunity for the Baltic activists to publicise the illegal Soviet occupation and position the question of Baltic independence not as a political matter but as a moral issue. The Soviet authorities in Moscow responded to the event with intense rhetoric but failed to take any constructive actions that could bridge the widening gap between the Baltic states and the Soviet Union. Within seven months of the protest Lithuania became the first of the Soviet republics to declare independence. After the Fall of Communism 23 August has become an official remembrance day both in the Baltic countries in the European Union and in other countries known as the Black Ribbon Day or as the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism. ,1

The instigator of the initial riots was a woman called Maria native of the freguesia of Fontarcada who would become known by the nickname of Maria da Fonte. As the initial phase of the insurrection had a strong female element she ended up giving her name to the revolt. The uprising afterwards spread to the remainder of the country and provoked the replacement of the government of Costa Cabral by one presided over by Pedro de Sousa Holstein 1st Duke of Palmela. When queen Maria II dismissed that government in a palace coup known as the Emboscada Ambush on October 6 that year and instead nominated marshal João Francisco de Saldanha Oliveira e Daun 1st Duke of Saldanha to form a new one the insurrection was reignited. The result was a civil war of 8 months known as the Patuleia that was only ended by the signing of the Convention of Gramido on 30 June 1847 after the intervention of foreign military forces from the Quadruple Alliance. ,1

The Revolution culminated in the territorial elections of 1954 where the long reign of the Hawaii Republican Party in the legislature came to an abrupt end as they were voted out of office to be replaced by members of the Democratic Party of Hawaii. The strikes by the Isles labor workers demanded similar pay and benefits to their Mainland counterparts. The strikes also crippled the power of the sugarcane plantations and the Big Five Oligopoly over their workers. ,1

235,http://dbpedia.org/resource/American_Revolution,The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy overthrew the authority of Great Britain and founded the United States of America. Starting in 1765 members of American colonial society rejected the authority of the British Parliament to tax them and to create other laws affecting them without colonial representatives in the government. During the following decade protests continued to escalate by colonists known as Patriots as in the Boston Tea Party in 1773 during which patriots destroyed a consignment of taxed tea from the Parliament-controlled and favored East India Company. The British responded by imposing punitive laws on Massachusetts in 1774 known as the Coercive Acts following which Patriots in the other colonies rallied behind Massachusetts. In late 1774 the Patriots set up their own alternative government to better coordinate their resistance efforts against Great Britain while other colonists known as Loyalists preferred to remain aligned to the British Crown. Tensions escalated to the outbreak of fighting between Patriot militia and British regulars at Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war during which the Patriots and later their French Spanish and Dutch allies fought the British and Loyalists in what became known as the American Revolutionary War 1775–1783. Patriots in each of the thirteen colonies formed Provincial Congresses that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism and from there built a Continental Army under the leadership of General George Washington. The Continental Congress determined King George III\s rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists\ rights as Englishmen and declared the colonies free and independent states in July 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy and proclaimed that all men are created equal. Congress rejected British proposals requiring allegiance to the monarchy and abandonment of independence. The British were forced out of Boston in 1776 but then captured and held New York City for the duration of the war. They blockaded the ports and captured other cities for brief periods but failed to defeat Washington\s forces. A British army was captured at the Battle of Saratoga in late 1777 after a failed patriot invasion of Canada following which the French openly entered the war as allies of the United States. The war later turned to the American South where the British captured an army at South Carolina but failed to enlist enough volunteers from Loyalist civilians to take effective control. A combined American–French force captured a second British army at Yorktown in 1781 effectively ending the war in the United States. The Treaty of Paris in 1783 formally ended the conflict confirming the new nation\s complete separation from the British Empire. The United States took possession of nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes with the British retaining control of Canada and Spain taking Florida. Among the significant results of the revolution was the creation of a new Constitution of the United States. The \Three-Fifths Compromise\ allowed the southern slaveholders to consolidate power and maintain slavery in America for another eighty years but the elected government became responsible to the will of the people through the expansion of voting rights and liberties over subsequent decades. The new Constitution established a relatively strong federal national government that included an executive a national judiciary and a bicameral Congress that represented states in the Senate and population in the House of Representatives. ,1

237,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Contras,The contras some references use the capitalized form Contras is a label given to the various U.S.-backed and funded right-wing rebel groups that were active from 1979 to the early 1990s in opposition to the left-wing socialist Sandinista Junta of National Reconstruction government in Nicaragua. Among the separate contra groups the Nicaraguan Democratic Force FDN emerged as the largest by far. In 1987 virtually all contra organizations were united at least nominally into the Nicaraguan Resistance. From an early stage the rebels received financial and military support from the United States government and their military significance decisively depended on it. After US support was banned by Congress the Reagan administration covertly continued it. These covert activities culminated in the Iran–Contra affair. The term contra comes from the Spanish contra which means against but in this case is short for la contrarrevolución in English the counter-revolution. Some rebels disliked being called contras feeling that it defined their cause only in negative terms or implied a desire to restore the old order. Rebel fighters usually referred to themselves as comandos commandos; peasant sympathizers also called the rebels los primos the cousins. From the mid-1980s as the Reagan administration and the rebels sought to portray the movement as the democratic resistance members started describing themselves as la resistencia. During their war against the Nicaraguan government the Contras committed a large number of human rights violations and used terrorist tactics and carried out more than 1300 terrorist attacks. These actions were frequently carried out systematically as a part of the strategy of the contras. Supporters of the Contras tried to minimize these violations particularly the Reagan administration in the US which engaged in a campaign of white propaganda to alter public opinion in favor of the contras. ,1
238,http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_Civil_War,The English Civil War 1642–1651 was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians Roundheads and Royalists Cavaliers over principally the manner of England\s government. The first 1642–46 and second 1648–49 wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament while the third 1649–51 saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. The overall outcome of the war was threefold: the trial and execution of Charles I; the exile of his son Charles II; and the replacement of English monarchy with at first the Commonwealth of England 1649–53 and then the Protectorate 1653–59 under Oliver Cromwell\s personal rule. The monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament\s consent although the idea of parliament as the ruling power of England was legally established as part of the Glorious Revolution in 1688. ,1
239,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Finnish_Civil_War,The Finnish Civil War 27 January – 15 May 1918 concerned leadership and control of Finland during the transition from a Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire to an independent state. The conflict formed a part of the national political and social turmoil caused by World War I Eastern Front in Europe. The war was fought between the Reds led by the Social Democratic Party and the Whites conducted by the non-socialist conservative-led senate. The paramilitary Red Guards composed of industrial and agrarian workers controlled the cities and industrial centers of southern Finland. The paramilitary White Guards composed of peasants and middle-class and upper-class factions controlled rural central and northern Finland. Finnish society had experienced rapid population growth industrialization pre-urbanization and the rise of a comprehensive labor movement. The countrys political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of democratization and modernization while the peoples socioeconomic condition and national-cultural status gradually improved. World War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire and a power struggle militarization and escalating crisis between the left-leaning Finnish labor movement and the Finnish conservatives. The Reds carried out an unsuccessful general offensive in February 1918 supplied with weapons by Soviet Russia. A counteroffensive by the Whites began in March reinforced by an Imperial German Army squad in April. The decisive military actions of the war were the Battles of Tampere and Viipuri won by the Whites and the Battles of Helsinki and Lahti won by German troops leading to overall victory of the Whites and the German forces. Both the Reds and Whites engaged in political terror. A large number of Reds perished due to malnutrition and disease in prison camps. Altogether around 39000 people died in the war including 36000 Finns - out of a population of 3000000. In the aftermath the Finns passed from Russian government to the German sphere of power. The Finnish conservatives tried to establish a Finnish monarchy but the plan was aborted by the defeat of Germany in World War I. Finland emerged as an independent democratic republic. The war divided the nation for many years and remains one of the most emotionally charged events in Finnish history. The society was reunited through social compromises based on a long-term culture of moderate politics and religion the outcome of World War I and the postwar economic recovery. ,1
240,http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution,The French Revolution French: Révolution française ʁevɔlysjɔ̃ fʁɑ̃sɛːz] was a period of far-reaching social and political upheaval in France that lasted from 1789 until 1799 and was partially carried forward by Napoleon during the later expansion of the French Empire. The Revolution overthrew the monarchy established a republic experienced violent periods of political turmoil and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies. Through the Revolutionary Wars it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history. The causes of the French Revolution are complex and are still debated among historians. Following the Seven Years War and the American Revolutionary War the French government was deeply in debt and attempted to restore its financial status through unpopular taxation schemes. Years of bad harvests leading up to the Revolution also inflamed popular resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the clergy and the aristocracy. Demands for change were formulated in terms of Enlightenment ideals and contributed to the convocation of the Estates-General in May 1789. The first year of the Revolution saw members of the Third Estate taking control the assault on the Bastille in July the passage of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in August and a womens march on Versailles that forced the royal court back to Paris in October. A central event of the first stage in August 1789 was the abolition of feudalism and the old rules and privileges left over from the Ancien Régime. The next few years featured political struggles between various liberal assemblies and right-wing supporters of the monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms. France rapidly transformed into a democratic and secular society with freedom of religion legalisation of divorce decriminalisation of same-sex relationships and civil rights for Jews and black people. The Republic was proclaimed in September 1792 after the French victory at Valmy. In a momentous event that led to international condemnation Louis XVI was executed in January 1793. External threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution. The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine – achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries. Internally popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins. The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror from 1793 until 1794 established price controls on food and other items abolished slavery in French colonies abroad dechristianised society through the creation of a new calendar and the expulsion of religious figures and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies. Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror with estimates ranging from 16000 to 40000. After the Thermidorian Reaction an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795. The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections debt repudiations financial instability persecutions against the Catholic clergy and significant military conquests abroad. Dogged by charges of corruption the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799. Napoleon who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns went on to establish the Consulate and later the First Empire setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the Napoleonic Wars. The modern era has unfolded in the shadow of the French Revolution. Almost all future revolutionary movements looked back to the Revolution as their predecessor. Its central phrases and cultural symbols such as La Marseillaise and Liberté égalité fraternité became the clarion call for other major upheavals in modern history including the Russian Revolution over a century later. The values and institutions of the Revolution dominate French politics to this day. The Revolution resulted in the suppression of the feudal system the emancipation of the individual the greater division of landed property the abolition of the privileges of noble birth and the establishment of equality. The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national for it aimed at benefiting all humanity. Globally the Revolution accelerated the rise of republics and democracies. It became the focal point for the development of all modern political ideologies leading to the spread of liberalism radicalism nationalism socialism feminism and secularism among many others. The Revolution also witnessed the birth of total war by organising the resources of France and the lives of its citizens towards the objective of military conquest. Some of its central documents like the Declaration of the Rights of Man expanded the arena of human rights to include women and slaves leading to movements for abolitionism and universal suffrage in the next century. ,1
241,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glorious_Revolution,The Glorious Revolution also called the Revolution of 1688 was the overthrow of King James II of England James VII of Scotland and James II of Ireland by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange-Nassau William of Orange. William\s successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascending of the English throne as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England James\s daughter in conjunction with the documentation of the Bill of Rights 1689. King James\s policies of religious tolerance after 1685 met with increasing opposition by members of leading political circles who were troubled by the king\s Catholicism and his close ties with France. The crisis facing the king came to a head in 1688 with the birth of the King\s son James Francis Edward Stuart on 10 June Julian calendar. This changed the existing line of succession by displacing the heir presumptive his daughter Mary a Protestant and the wife of William of Orange with young James as heir apparent. The establishment of a Roman Catholic dynasty in the kingdoms now seemed likely. Some of the most influential leaders of the Tories united with members of the opposition Whigs and set out to resolve the crisis by inviting William of Orange to England which the stadtholder who feared an Anglo-French alliance had indicated as a condition for a military intervention. After consolidating political and financial support William crossed the North Sea and English Channel with a large invasion fleet in November 1688 landing at Torbay. After only two minor clashes between the two opposing armies in England and anti-Catholic riots in several towns James\s regime collapsed largely because of a lack of resolve shown by the king. However this was followed by the protracted Williamite War in Ireland and Dundee\s rising in Scotland. In England\s distant American colonies the revolution led to the collapse of the Dominion of New England and the overthrow of the Province of Maryland\s government. Following a defeat of his forces at the Battle of Reading on 9 December James and his wife Mary fled England; James however returned to London for a two-week period that culminated in his final departure for France on 23 December. By threatening to withdraw his troops William in February 1689 New Style Julian calendar convinced a newly chosen Convention Parliament to make him and his wife joint monarchs. The Revolution permanently ended any chance of Catholicism becoming re-established in England. For British Catholics its effects were disastrous both socially and politically: Catholics were denied the right to vote and sit in the Westminster Parliament for over a century; they were also denied commissions in the army and the monarch was forbidden to be Catholic or to marry a Catholic this latter prohibition remaining in force until the UK\s Succession to the Crown Act 2013 removed it in 2015. The Revolution led to limited toleration for Nonconformist Protestants although it would be some time before they had full political rights. It has been argued mainly by Whig historians that James\s overthrow began modern English parliamentary democracy: the Bill of Rights 1689 has become one of the most important documents in the political history of Britain and never since has the monarch held absolute power. Internationally the Revolution was related to the War of the Grand Alliance on mainland Europe. It has been seen as the last successful invasion of England. It ended all attempts by England in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century to subdue the Dutch Republic by military force. However the resulting economic integration and military co-operation between the English and Dutch navies shifted the dominance in world trade from the Dutch Republic to England and later to Great Britain. The expression Glorious Revolution was first used by John Hampden in late 1689 and is an expression that is still used by the British Parliament. The Glorious Revolution is also occasionally termed the Bloodless Revolution albeit inaccurately. The English Civil War also known as the Great Rebellion was still within living memory for most of the major English participants in the events of 1688 and for them in comparison to that war or even the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685 the deaths in the conflict of 1688 were mercifully few. ,1
242,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Industrial_Revolution,The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes improved efficiency of water power the increasing use of steam power the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British. The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries. At approximately the same time the Industrial Revolution was occurring Britain was undergoing an agricultural revolution which also helped to improve living standards and provided surplus labour available for industry. Mechanised textile production spread from Great Britain to continental Europe in the early 19th century with important centres of textiles iron and coal emerging in Belgium and later in France. Since then industrialisation has spread throughout much of the world. The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians as is the pace of economic and social changes. GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies. Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals and plants. The First Industrial Revolution evolved into the Second Industrial Revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870 when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport steam-powered railways boats and ships the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam-powered factories. ,1

Oktjabrjskaja revoljucija; IPA: ɐkˈtʲabrʲskəjə rʲɪvɐˈlʲutsɨjə] officially known in the Soviet literature as the Great October Socialist Revolution Russian: Вели́кая Октя́брьская социалисти́ческая револю́ция tr. Velikaja Oktjabrjskaja socialističeskaja revoljucija and commonly referred to as Red October the October Uprising or the Bolshevik Revolution was a seizure of state power instrumental in the larger Russian Revolution of 1917. It took place with an armed insurrection in Petrograd traditionally dated to 25 October 1917 by the Julian or Old Style calendar which corresponds to 7 November 1917 in the Gregorian or New Style calendar. It followed and capitalized on the February Revolution of the same year which overthrew the Tsarist autocracy and resulted in a provisional government after a transfer of power proclaimed by Grand Duke Michael brother of Tsar Nicolas II who declined to take power after the Tsar stepped down. During this time urban workers began to organize into councils Russian: Soviet wherein revolutionaries criticized the provisional government and its actions. The October Revolution in Petrograd overthrew the provisional government and gave the power to the local soviets. The Bolshevik party was heavily supported by the soviets. After the Congress of Soviets now the governing body had its second session it elected members of the Bolsheviks and other leftist groups such as the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to key positions within the new state of affairs. This immediately initiated the establishment of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic the worlds first self-proclaimed socialist state. The revolution was led by the Bolsheviks who used their influence in the Petrograd Soviet to organize the armed forces. Bolshevik Red Guards forces under the Military Revolutionary Committee began the takeover of government buildings on 24 October 1917 O.S.. The following day the Winter Palace the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd then capital of Russia was captured. The long-awaited Constituent Assembly elections were held on 12 November 1917. The Bolsheviks only won 175 seats in the 715 seat legislative body coming in second behind the Socialist Revolutionary party which won 370 seats. The Constituent Assembly was to first meet on 28 November 1917 but its convocation was delayed until 5 January 1918 by the Bolsheviks. On its first and only day in session the body rejected Soviet decrees on peace and land and was dissolved the next day by order of the Congress of Soviets. As the revolution was not universally recognized there followed the struggles of the Russian Civil War 1917–22 and the creation of the Soviet Union in 1922. ,1
244,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paradigm_shift,A paradigm shift as identified by American physicist and philosopher Thomas Kuhn is a fundamental change in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline. Kuhn contrasted these shifts which characterize a scientific revolution to the activity of normal science which he described as scientific work done within a prevailing framework or paradigm. In this context the word paradigm is used in its original meaning as example Greek: παράδειγμα. The nature of scientific revolutions has been a question posed by modern philosophy since Immanuel Kant used the phrase in the preface to his Critique of Pure Reason 1781 referring to Greek mathematics and Newtonian physics. In the 20th century new crises in the basic concepts of mathematics physics and biology revitalized interest in the question among scholars. It was against this active background that Kuhn published his work. Kuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions 1962. As one commentator summarizes: Kuhn acknowledges having used the term paradigm in two different meanings. In the first one paradigm designates what the members of a certain scientific community have in common that is to say the whole of techniques patents and values shared by the members of the community. In the second sense the paradigm is a single element of a whole say for instance Newton’s Principia which acting as a common model or an example... stands for the explicit rules and thus defines a coherent tradition of investigation. Thus the question is for Kuhn to investigate by means of the paradigm what makes possible the constitution of what he calls normal science. That is to say the science which can decide if a certain problem will be considered scientific or not. Normal science does not mean at all a science guided by a coherent system of rules on the contrary the rules can be derived from the paradigms but the paradigms can guide the investigation also in the absence of rules. This is precisely the second meaning of the term paradigm which Kuhn considered the most new and profound though it is in truth the oldest. Since the 1960s the concept of a paradigm shift has also been used in numerous non-scientific contexts to describe a profound change in a fundamental model or perception of events even though Kuhn himself restricted the use of the term to the hard sciences. In a 2015 retrospective on Kuhn the philosopher Martin Cohen describes the notion of the ‘Paradigm Shift’ as a kind of intellectual virus – spreading from hard science to social science and on to the arts and even everyday political rhetoric today. Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what it might mean and in line with the American philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive. ,1
245,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prague_Spring,The Prague Spring Czech: Pražské jaro Slovak: Pražská jar was a period of political liberalization in Czechoslovakia during the era of its domination by the Soviet Union after World War II. It began on 5 January 1968 when reformist Alexander Dubček was elected First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia KSČ and continued until 21 August when the Soviet Union and other members of the Warsaw Pact invaded the country to halt the reforms. The Prague Spring reforms were a strong attempt by Dubček to grant additional rights to the citizens of Czechoslovakia in an act of partial decentralization of the economy and democratization. The freedoms granted included a loosening of restrictions on the media speech and travel. After national discussion of dividing the country into a federation of three republics Bohemia Moravia-Silesia and Slovakia Dubček oversaw the decision to split into two the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. This was the only formal change that survived the end of Prague Spring though the relative success of the nonviolent resistance undoubtedly prefigured and facilitated the peaceful transition to liberal democracy with the collapse of Soviet hegemony in 1989. The reforms especially the decentralization of administrative authority were not received well by the Soviets who after failed negotiations sent half a million Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country. A large wave of emigration swept the nation. A spirited non-violent resistance was mounted throughout the country involving attempted fraternization painting over and turning street signs on one occasion an entire invasion force from Poland was routed back out of the country after a days wandering defiance of various curfews etc. While the Soviet military had predicted that it would take four days to subdue the country the resistance held out for eight months and was only circumvented by diplomatic stratagems see below. There were sporadic acts of violence and several suicides by self-immolation such as that of Jan Palach but there was no military resistance. Czechoslovakia remained controlled until 1989 when the velvet revolution ended pro-Soviet rule peacefully undoubtedly drawing upon the successes of the non-violent resistance twenty years earlier. The resistance also became an iconic example of civilian-based defense which along with unarmed civilian peacekeeping constitute the two ways that nonviolence can be and occasionally has been applied directly to military or paramilitary threats. After the invasion Czechoslovakia entered a period of normalization: subsequent leaders attempted to restore the political and economic values that had prevailed before Dubček gained control of the KSČ. Gustáv Husák who replaced Dubček and also became president reversed almost all of Dubčeks reforms. The Prague Spring inspired music and literature such as the work of Václav Havel Karel Husa Karel Kryl and Milan Kunderas novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being. ,1
246,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russian_Revolution,Russian Revolution is the collective term for a pair of revolutions in Russia in 1917 which dismantled the Tsarist autocracy and led to the eventual rise of the Soviet Union. The Russian Empire collapsed with the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II and the old regime was replaced by a provisional government during the first revolution of February 1917 March in the Gregorian calendar; the older Julian calendar was in use in Russia at the time. In the second revolution that October the Provisional Government was removed and replaced with a Bolshevik Communist government. The February Revolution March 1917 was a revolution focused around Petrograd now Saint Petersburg then capital of Russia. In the chaos members of the Imperial parliament or Duma assumed control of the country forming the Russian Provisional Government. The army leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution resulting in Nicholas\ abdication. The Soviets workers\ councils which were led by more radical socialist factions initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias. The February Revolution took place in the context of heavy military setbacks during the First World War 1914–18 which left much of the Russian Army in a state of mutiny. A period of dual power ensued during which the Provisional Government held state power while the national network of Soviets led by socialists had the allegiance of the lower classes and the political left. During this chaotic period there were frequent mutinies protests and many strikes. When the Provisional Government chose to continue fighting the war with Germany the Bolsheviks and other socialist factions campaigned for stopping the conflict. The Bolsheviks turned workers militias under their control into the Red Guards later the Red Army over which they exerted substantial control. In the October Revolution November in the Gregorian calendar the Bolshevik party led by Vladimir Lenin and the workers\ Soviets overthrew the Provisional Government in Petrograd and established the Russian SFSR eventually shifting the capital to Moscow in 1918. The Bolsheviks appointed themselves as leaders of various government ministries and seized control of the countryside establishing the Cheka to quash dissent. To end Russia’s participation in the First World War the Bolshevik leaders signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany in March 1918. Civil war erupted among the Reds Bolsheviks the Whites anti-socialist factions and non-Bolshevik socialists. It continued for several years during which the Bolsheviks defeated both the Whites and all rival socialists. In this way the Revolution paved the way for the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics USSR in 1922. While many notable historical events occurred in Moscow and Petrograd there was also a visible movement in cities throughout the state among national minorities throughout the empire and in the rural areas where peasants took over and redistributed land. ,1
247,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sinatra_Doctrine,Sinatra Doctrine was the name that the Soviet government of Mikhail Gorbachev used jokingly to describe its policy of allowing neighboring Warsaw Pact states to determine their own internal affairs. The name alluded to the song My Way popularized by Frank Sinatra—the Soviet Union was allowing these states to go their own way. This was a major break with the earlier Brezhnev Doctrine under which the internal affairs of satellite states were tightly controlled by Moscow. This had been used to justify the crushing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 as well as the invasion of the non-Warsaw Pact nation of Afghanistan in 1979. By the late 1980s structural flaws within the Soviet system growing economic problems the rise of anti-communist sentiment and the effects of the Soviet-Afghan War made it increasingly impractical for the Soviet Union to impose its will on its neighbors. The phrase was coined on 25 October 1989 by Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov. He was speaking to reporters in Helsinki about a speech made two days earlier by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. The latter had said that the Soviets recognized the freedom of choice of all countries specifically including the other Warsaw Pact states. Gerasimov told the interviewer that We now have the Frank Sinatra doctrine. He has a song I Did It My Way. So every country decides on its own which road to take. When asked whether this would include Moscow accepting the rejection of communist parties in the Soviet bloc. He replied: That\s for sure… political structures must be decided by the people who live there. The Sinatra Doctrine has been seen as Moscow giving permission to its allies to decide their own futures. In fact it was a retrospective policy as Soviet allies had already acquired much greater freedom of action. A month before Gerasimov\s statement Poland had elected its first non-communist government since the 1940s. The government of Hungary had opened its border with Austria in August 1989 dismantling the Iron Curtain on its own border. As Hungary was one of the few countries that East Germans could travel to thousands travelled there so that they could flee across the newly opened border to the West. To the great annoyance of the East German government the Hungarians refused to stop the exodus. These developments greatly disturbed hardline communists such as the East German leader Erich Honecker who condemned the end of the traditional socialist unity of the Soviet bloc and appealed to Moscow to rein in the Hungarians. Honecker faced a growing crisis at home with massive anti-government demonstrations in Leipzig and other East German cities. Shevardnadze\s speech and Gerasimov\s memorable description of the new policy amounted to a rebuff of Honecker\s appeals. The proclamation of the Sinatra Doctrine had dramatic effects across the Soviet bloc. The beleaguered East German government had hoped for a Soviet intervention to defend communism in East Germany and elsewhere. However the announcement of the Sinatra Doctrine signalled that the Soviet Union would not aid the East German communists. A few weeks later the communist governments of East Germany Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria were ousted and two months later the communist rulers of Romania suffered the same fate signalling an end to the Cold War and to the division of Europe. ,1

Károlyi had helped establish the social democratic Hungarian National Council HNC which demanded the secession of Hungary from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In the early morning hours of 31 October 1918 with support of the soldiers from the Hungarian Army HNC protesters wearing the aster flowers helped seize public buildings throughout Budapest. Prime Minister Sándor Wekerle resigned and former Prime Minister István Tisza was murdered. By the end of the day King Charles IV had accepted the coup and appointed Károlyi as Hungarys new Prime Minister. The Hungarian Democratic Republic was proclaimed on 16 November 1918 with Károlyi named as president. In March 1919 the republic was itself overturned a revolution which created the communist Hungarian Soviet Republic. The Soviet Republic was soon defeated and the monarchy restored although as an independent country. ,1

The scope of the protests expanded with many calls for the resignation of President Viktor Yanukovych and his government. The protests led to the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. Many protesters joined because of the violent dispersal of protesters on 30 November and a will to change life in Ukraine. By 25 January 2014 the protests had been fueled by the perception of widespread government corruption abuse of power and violation of human rights in Ukraine. Transparency International named President Yanukovych as the top example of corruption in the world. Protests climaxed in mid-February. Police and protesters fired live and rubber ammunition across multiple locations in Kiev. Riot police advanced towards Maidan and clashed with protesters but did not fully occupy it. Fighting continued the following days which saw the vast majority of casualties. In connection with the events of February 18–20 Yanukovych was forced to make concessions to the opposition to end the bloodshed in Kiev and end the crisis. The Agreement on settlement of political crisis in Ukraine was signed by Vitaly Klitschko Arseny Yatsenyuk Oleh Tyahnybok. The signing was witnessed by the Foreign Ministers of Germany and Poland Frank-Walter Steinmeier Radosław Sikorski respectively and the Director of the Continental Europe Department of the French Foreign Ministry Eric Fournier. Vladimir Lukin representing Russia refused to sign the agreement. In late February 2014 Yanukovych and many other high government officials fled the country. Protesters gained control of the presidential administration and Yanukovych\s private estate. Subsequently the parliament removed Yanukovych from office replaced the government with a pro-European one and ordered that former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko be released from prison. Events in Kiev were soon followed by the Crimean crisis and pro-Russian unrest in Eastern Ukraine. Despite the impeachment of Yanukovych the installation of a new government and the adoption of the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement\s political provisions the protests have sustained pressure on the government to reject Russian influence in Ukraine. ,1

The revolution in the Kingdom of Hungary grew into a war for independence from the Austrian Empire ruled by the Habsburg dynasty. After a series of serious Austrian defeats in 1849 the Austrian State came close to the brink of collapse thus the new young emperor Franz Joseph I had to call for Russian help in the name of the Holy Alliance. Czar Nicholas I answered and sent a 200000 men strong army with 80000 auxiliary forces. Finally the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian forces. After the restoration of Habsburg power Hungary was placed under brutal martial law. The anniversary of the Revolutions outbreak 15 March is one of Hungarys three national holidays. ,1

Though leaderless when it first began it was the first major threat to Soviet control since the USSRs forces drove out Nazi Germany from its territory at the end of World War II and broke into Central and Eastern Europe. The revolt began as a student demonstration which attracted thousands as they marched through central Budapest to the Parliament building calling out on the streets using a van with loudspeakers via Radio Free Europe. A student delegation entering the radio building to try to broadcast the students demands was detained. When the delegations release was demanded by the demonstrators outside they were fired upon by the State Security Police ÁVH from within the building. One student died and was wrapped in a flag and held above the crowd. This was the start of the revolution. As the news spread disorder and violence erupted throughout the capital. The revolt spread quickly across Hungary and the government collapsed. Thousands organised into militias battling the ÁVH and Soviet troops. Pro-Soviet communists and ÁVH members were often executed or imprisoned and former political prisoners were released and armed. Radical impromptu workers councils wrested municipal control from the ruling Hungarian Working Peoples Party and demanded political changes. A new government formally disbanded the ÁVH declared its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and pledged to re-establish free elections. By the end of October fighting had almost stopped and a sense of normality began to return. After announcing a willingness to negotiate a withdrawal of Soviet forces the Politburo changed its mind and moved to crush the revolution. On 4 November a large Soviet force invaded Budapest and other regions of the country. The Hungarian resistance continued until 10 November. Over 2500 Hungarians and 700 Soviet troops were killed in the conflict and 200000 Hungarians fled as refugees. Mass arrests and denunciations continued for months thereafter. By January 1957 the new Soviet-installed government had suppressed all public opposition. These Soviet actions while strengthening control over the Eastern Bloc alienated many Western Marxists leading to splits and/or considerable losses of membership for Communist Parties in the West. Public discussion about this revolution was suppressed in Hungary for more than 30 years. Since the thaw of the 1980s it has been a subject of intense study and debate. At the inauguration of the Third Hungarian Republic in 1989 23 October was declared a national holiday. ,1

In France the  ended the Orleans monarchy 1830–48 and led to the creation of the French Second Republic. Following the overthrow of King Louis Philippe in February the elected government of the Second Republic ruled France. In the months that followed this government steered a course that became more conservative. On 23 June 1848 the people of Paris rose in insurrection which became known as June Days Uprising – a bloody but unsuccessful rebellion by the Paris workers against a conservative turn in the Republic\s course. On 2 December 1848 Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was elected President of the Second Republic largely on peasant support. Exactly four years later he suspended the elected assembly establishing the Second French Empire which lasted until 1870. Louis Napoléon would go on to become the de facto last French monarch. The February revolution established the principle of the right to work droit au travail and its newly established government created National Workshops for the unemployed. At the same time a sort of industrial parliament was established at the Luxembourg Palace under the presidency of Louis Blanc with the object of preparing a scheme for the organization of labour. These tensions between liberal Orleanist and Radical Republicans and Socialists led to the June Days Uprising. ,1

259,http://dbpedia.org/resource/5_October_1910_revolution,The establishment of the Portuguese Republic was the result of a coup détat organised by the Portuguese Republican Party which on 5 October 1910 deposed the constitutional monarchy and established a republican regime in Portugal. The subjugation of the country to British colonial interests the royal familys expenses the power of the Church the political and social instability the system of alternating power of the two political parties Progressive and Regenerador João Francos dictatorship an apparent inability to adapt to modern times – all contributed to an unrelenting erosion of the Portuguese monarchy. The proponents of the republic particularly the Republican Party found ways to take advantage of the situation. The Republican Party presented itself as the only one that had a programme that was capable of returning to the country its lost status and place Portugal on the way of progress. After a reluctance of the military to combat the nearly two thousand soldiers and sailors that rebelled between 3 and 4 October 1910 the Republic was proclaimed at 9 oclock of the next day from the balcony of the Paços do Concelho in Lisbon. After the revolution a provisional government led by Teófilo Braga directed the fate of the country until the approval of the Constitution in 1911 that marked the beginning of the First Republic. Among other things with the establishment of the republic national symbols were changed: the national anthem and the flag. The revolution produced some civil and religious liberties although there was no advance in womens rights and in workers rights unlike what happened in other European countries. ,1

Its central principle is that vanguardism by cadres of small fast-moving paramilitary groups can provide a focus in Spanish foco for popular discontent against a sitting regime and thereby lead a general insurrection. Although the original approach was to mobilize and launch attacks from rural areas many foco ideas were adapted into urban guerrilla warfare movements by the late 1960s. ,1

The Revolution marked a significant period in Nicaraguan history and revealed the country as one of the major proxy war battlegrounds of the Cold War with the events in the country rising to international attention. Although the initial overthrow of the Somoza regime in 1978–79 was a bloody affair the Contra War of the 1980s took the lives of tens of thousands of Nicaraguans and was the subject of fierce international debate. During the 1980s both the FSLN a leftist collection of political parties and the Contras a rightist collection of counter-revolutionary groups received large amounts of aid from the Cold War super-powers respectively the Soviet Union and the United States. The Contra War ultimately ended following the signing of the Tela Accord in 1989 and the demobilization of the FSLN and Contra armies. A second election in 1990 resulted in the election of a majority of anti-Sandinista parties and the FSLN handing over power. ,1
262,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philippine_Revolution,The Philippine Revolution Filipino: Himagsikang Pilipino also called the Tagalog War by the Spanish was a revolution and subsequent conflict fought between the people of the Philippines and the Spanish colonial authorities. The Philippine Revolution began in August 1896 when the Spanish authorities discovered Katipunan an anti-colonial secret organization. The Katipunan led by Andrés Bonifacio was a liberationist movement whose goal was independence from Spain through armed revolt. The organization began to influence much of the Philippines. During a mass gathering in Caloocan the leaders of Katipunan organized themselves into a revolutionary government named the newly established government Haring Bayang Katagalugan and openly declared a nationwide armed revolution. Bonifacio called for an attack on the capital city of Manila. This attack failed; however the surrounding provinces began to revolt. In particular rebels in Cavite led by Mariano Alvarez and Emilio Aguinaldo who were from two different factions of Katipunan won early victories. A power struggle among the revolutionaries led to Bonifacio\s death in 1897 with command shifting to Aguinaldo who led his own revolutionary government. That year the revolutionaries and the Spanish signed the Pact of Biak-na-Bato which temporarily reduced hostilities. Aguinaldo self-exiled himself to Hong Kong. However the hostilities never completely ceased. On April 21 1898 the United States launched a naval blockade of Cuba which was the first military action of the Spanish–American War. On May 1 the U.S. Navy\s Asiatic Squadron under Commodore George Dewey decisively defeated the Spanish navy in the Battle of Manila Bay effectively seizing control of Manila. On May 19 Aguinaldo unofficially allied with the United States returned to the Philippines and resumed attacks against the Spaniards. By June the rebels had gained control of nearly all of the Philippines with the exception of Manila. On June 12 Aguinaldo issued the Philippine Declaration of Independence. Although this signified the end date of the revolution neither Spain nor the United States recognized Philippine independence. The Spanish rule of the Philippines officially ended with the Treaty of Paris of 1898 which also ended the Spanish–American War. In the treaty Spain ceded control of the Philippines and other territories to the United States. There was an uneasy peace around Manila with the American forces controlling the city and the weaker Philippines forces surrounding them. On February 4 1899 in the Battle of Manila fighting broke out between the Filipino and American forces beginning the Philippine–American War. Aguinaldo immediately ordered t]hat peace and friendly relations with the Americans be broken and that the latter be treated as enemies. In June 1899 the nascent First Philippine Republic formally declared war against the United States. The Philippines would not become an internationally recognized independent state until 1946. ,1

It eventually led to a thorough democratization of the country and to free and democratic elections. They saw the victory of a coalition of the Islamist Ennahda Movement with the centre-left Congress for the Republic and the left-leaning Ettakatol as minority partners. The demonstrations were precipitated by high unemployment food inflation corruption a lack of political freedoms like freedom of speech and poor living conditions. The protests constituted the most dramatic wave of social and political unrest in Tunisia in three decades and resulted in scores of deaths and injuries most of which were the result of action by police and security forces against demonstrators. The protests were sparked by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi on 17 December 2010 and led to the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 28 days later on 14 January 2011 when he officially resigned after fleeing to Saudi Arabia ending 23 years in power. Labour unions were said to be an integral part of the protests. The Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet was awarded the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize for its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Tunisian Revolution of 2011. The protests inspired similar actions throughout the Arab world. Following Ben Ali\s departure from the country a state of emergency was declared. The Constitutional Court affirmed Fouad Mebazaa as acting president under Article 57 of the Constitution. A caretaker coalition government was also created including members of Ben Ali\s party the Constitutional Democratic Rally CDR in key ministries while including other opposition figures in other ministries with elections to take place within 60 days. However five newly appointed non-CDR ministers resigned almost immediately and daily street protests in Tunis and other towns around Tunisia continued demanding that the new government have no CDR members and that the CDR itself be disbanded. On 27 January Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi reshuffled the government removing all former CDR members other than himself. On 6 February the new interior minister suspended all party activities of the CDR citing security reasons. The party was dissolved as protesters had demanded on 9 March 2011.

Zanzibar was an ethnically diverse state consisting of a number of islands off the east coast of Tanganyika which had been granted independence by Britain in 1963. In a series of parliamentary elections preceding independence the Arab minority succeeded in retaining the hold on power it had inherited from Zanzibars former existence as an overseas territory of Oman. Frustrated by under-representation in Parliament despite winning 54% of the vote in the July 1963 election the mainly African Afro-Shirazi Party ASP allied itself with the left-wing Umma Party and early on the morning of 12 January 1964 ASP member John Okello mobilised around 600–800 revolutionaries on the main island of Unguja Zanzibar Island. Having overrun the countrys police force and appropriated their weaponry the insurgents proceeded to Zanzibar Town where they overthrew the Sultan and his government. Reprisals against Arab and South Asian civilians on the island followed; the resulting death toll is disputed with estimates ranging from several hundred to 20000. The moderate ASP leader Abeid Karume became the countrys new president and head of state and positions of power were granted to Umma party members. The new governments apparent communist ties concerned Western governments. As Zanzibar lay within the British sphere of influence the British government drew up a number of intervention plans. However the feared communist government never materialised and because British and United States citizens were successfully evacuated these plans were not put into effect. Meanwhile the communist bloc powers of China East Germany and the Soviet Union established friendly relations with the new government by recognising the country and sending advisors. Karume succeeded in negotiating a merger of Zanzibar with Tanganyika to form the new nation of Tanzania; an act judged by contemporary media to be an attempt to prevent communist subversion of Zanzibar. The revolution ended 200 years of Arab dominance in Zanzibar and is commemorated on the island each year with anniversary celebrations and a public holiday. ,1

In April 2011 women in Jeddah Riyadh and Dammam tried to register as electors for the 29 September municipal elections despite officials stating that women could not participate. In May and June Manal al-Sharif and other women organised a women\s right-to-drive campaign with the main action to take place on 17 June. In late September Shaima Jastania was sentenced to 10 lashes for driving in Jeddah shortly after King Abdullah announced women\s participation in the 2015 municipal elections and eligibility as Consultative Assembly members; King Abdullah overturned the sentence. Al-Sharif and Samar Badawi filed lawsuits against Saudi authorities in the Grievances Board a non-Sharia court because of the rejection of their driving licence applications. Women university students protested in King Khalid University KKU in Abha in March 2012 and were attacked by security forces leading to one death. Other university protests followed in Taibah University in Medina and Tabuk University in March and April. KKU students called for the university president to be dismissed. He was replaced on 1 July 2012. ,1
275,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arab_Agricultural_Revolution,The Arab Agricultural Revolution also referred to variously as Medieval Green Revolution Muslim Agricultural Revolution Islamic Agricultural Revolution and Islamic Green Revolution is the name given by the historian Andrew Watson in an influential 1974 paper to what he argued was a fundamental transformation in agriculture from the 8th to the 13th century in the Islamic region of the Old World. He listed eighteen crops that were widely diffused during the Islamic period including four staple crops namely durum wheat Asiatic rice sorghum and cotton. He also argued that techniques such as irrigation were spread across the region at that time. Scholars such as the historian Michael Decker have disagreed with parts of Watsons proposal arguing that the four staple crops were already widely disseminated before that period and that Islamic irrigation built on rather than replacing the Roman irrigation network in Spain. However the historian Paolo Squatriti reviewing Watsons paper 40 years on noted that it had proven useful to many different historical agendas and had held up surprisingly well in the face of new findings in archaeology and archaeobotany. ,1

The slogan first emerged during the Tunisian Revolution. The chant echoed at Avenue Habib Bourguiba in Tunis for weeks. The slogan also became used frequently during the 2011 Egyptian revolution. It was the most frequent slogan both in graffiti and in chants in rallies during the revolution in Egypt. The chant was raised at the protests in Bahrain. Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam has been used frequently in protests across Yemen. The slogan was used in rallies across Libya at the beginning of the 2011 revolt. In March 2011 a group of youths under the age of 15 were arrested in Dera\a in southern Syria after having sprayed ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam graffiti. Their arrests sparked the uprising in Syria. The slogan was also used frequently in Sudan throughout the protests. In Jordan a youth group named 24 March used the slogan ash-shaʻb yurīd islah an-niẓām the people want to reform the system. However the slogan later changed to ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam in November 2012 when the government imposed a hike in the price of fuel. In Lebanon the slogan has been used in protests against that country\s sectarian political system. In the Lebanese protests an-nizam the regime referred to the sectarian political order as such rather the government. In Palestine a variation of the slogan Ash-shaʻb yurīd inhāʼ al-inqisām الشعب يريد إنهاء الانقسام the people want the division to end emerged in protests calling for the two main factions Fatah and Hamas to settle their differences. A parody of the slogan has been used by Bashar al-Assad\s supporters in Syria as ash-shaʻb yurīd Bashār al-Asad الشعب يريد بشار الاسد the people want Bashar al-Assad. Another parody of the slogan has been used by King Hamad\s loyalist in Bahrain as ash-shaʻb yurīd isqāṭ al-Wifāq the people want to bring down Al-Wefaq referring to the main opposition party of Bahrain Al-Wefaq. ,1
277,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bashmurian_revolt,Bashmurian revolt Arabic ثورة البشموريين also Peshmurian revolt was the revolt of the Coptic Christians living in the Al-Bashmur area in North Nile Delta against the Abbasids which occurred around 832. The revolt and others previous were attributed to oppressive taxation. The rebels expelled the state workers and raised the banner of rebellion refusing to pay tribute special tax on non-Muslims called the jizya. Caliph Al-Ma\mun who was visiting the province put down the rebellion arresting and killing large numbers of Copts and their dependants. According to historian Ira M. Lapidus the crushing of the rebellion was followed by despair among the Copts and mass conversions to Islam which rendered the ex-Copts exempt from Jizyah tax. ,1
278,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communist_revolution,A communist revolution is a proletarian revolution often but not necessarily inspired by the ideas of Marxism that aims to replace capitalism with communism typically with socialism as an intermediate stage. The idea that a proletarian revolution is needed is a cornerstone of Marxism; Marxists believe that the workers of the world must unite and free themselves from capitalist oppression to create a world run by and for the working class. Thus in the Marxist view proletarian revolutions need to happen in countries all over the world. Leninism argues that a communist revolution must be led by a vanguard of professional revolutionaries men and women who are fully dedicated to the communist cause and who can then form the nucleus of the revolutionary movement. Some Marxists disagree with the idea of a vanguard as put forth by Lenin especially left communists. Some who continue to consider themselves Marxist–Leninists also oppose the vanguard despite disagreeing with the majority of left communism. These critics insist that the entire working class—or at least a large part of it—must be deeply involved and equally committed to the socialist or communist cause in order for a proletarian revolution to be successful. To this end they seek to build massive communist parties with very large memberships. ,1
279,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egyptian_crisis_(2011–14),The Egyptian crisis began with the Egyptian revolution of 2011 when hundreds of thousands of Egyptians took to the streets in an ideologically and socially diverse mass protest movement that ultimately forced longtime president Hosni Mubarak from office. A protracted political crisis ensued with the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces taking control of the country until a series of popular elections brought the Muslim Brotherhood to power. However disputes between elected Islamist president Mohamed Morsi and secularists continued until the anti-government protests in June 2013 that lead to the overthrow of Morsi in 2013 in what has been variably described as a coup détat or as an ending to the second revolution or both. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi who announced the overthrow of Morsi then became the leader of Egypt the following year winning election to the presidency in a landslide victory described by EU observers as free but not necessarily fair. Nonetheless Sisis election was widely recognized and the political situation has largely stabilized since he officially took power; however some protests have continued despite a government crackdown. The crisis has also spawned an ongoing insurgency led by Ansar Beit al-Maqdis in the Sinai peninsula which became increasingly intertwined with the regional conflict against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant later in 2014. ,1
280,http://dbpedia.org/resource/February_Revolution,The February Revolution Russian: Февра́льская револю́ция; IPA: fʲɪvˈralʲskəjə rʲɪvɐˈlʲutsɨjə] known in Soviet historiography as the February Bourgeois Democratic Revolution was the first of two revolutions in Russia in 1917. It was centered on Petrograd now known as St. Petersburg then the Russian capital on Womens Day in March late February in the Julian calendar. The revolution was confined to the capital and its vicinity and lasted less than a week. It involved mass demonstrations and armed clashes with police and gendarmes the last loyal forces of the Russian monarchy. In the last days mutinous Russian Army forces sided with the revolutionaries. The immediate result of the revolution was the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II the end of the Romanov dynasty and the end of the Russian Empire. The Tsar was replaced by a Russian Provisional Government under Prince Georgy Lvov. The Provisional Government was an alliance between liberals and socialists who wanted political reform. They set up a democratically-elected executive and constituent assembly. At the same time socialists also formed the Petrograd Soviet which ruled alongside the Provisional Government an arrangement termed Dual Power. This revolution appeared to break out spontaneously without any real leadership or formal planning. Russia had been suffering from a number of economic and social problems which were compounded by the impact of World War I. Bread rioters and industrial strikers were joined on the streets by disaffected soldiers from the citys garrison. As more and more troops deserted and with loyal troops away at the Front the city fell into chaos leading to the overthrow of the Tsar. The February Revolution was followed in the same year by the October Revolution bringing Bolshevik rule and a change in Russias social structure and paving the way for the Soviet Union. ,1

It is sometimes referred to as the 5 October Overthrow and sometimes colloquially called the Bager revolucija translated into English as Bulldozer Revolution after one of the most memorable episodes from the day-long protest in which an engineering vehicle operator Ljubisav Đokić fired up his engine which was actually neither bulldozer nor bager excavator but a wheel loader and used it to charge the RTS building which was considered a symbol of regime propaganda of Slobodan Milosevic and his ruling party who controlled and censored outflow of information for the public. ,1
282,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Permanent_revolution,Permanent revolution is a term within Marxist theory established in usage by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels by at least 1850 but which has since become most closely associated with Leon Trotsky. The use of the term by different theorists is not identical. Marx used it to describe the strategy of a revolutionary class to continue to pursue its class interests independently and without compromise despite overtures for political alliances and despite the political dominance of opposing sections of society. Trotsky put forward his conception of permanent revolution as an explanation of how socialist revolutions could occur in societies that had not achieved advanced capitalism. Part of his theory is the supposed impossibility of socialism in one country. Trotsky\s theory also argues first that the bourgeoisie in late-developing capitalist countries are incapable of developing the productive forces in such a manner as to achieve the sort of advanced capitalism which will fully develop an industrial proletariat. Second that the proletariat can and must therefore seize social economic and political power leading an alliance with the peasantry. ,1
283,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protests_in_Sudan_(2011–13),Protests in Sudan also nicknamed as the Sudanese Intifada began in January 2011 as part of the Arab Spring regional protest movement. Unlike in other Arab countries popular uprisings in Sudan had succeeded in toppling the government prior to the Arab Spring in 1964 and 1985. Demonstrations in Sudan however were less common throughout the summer of 2011 during which South Sudan seceded from Sudan but resumed in force later that year and again in June 2012 shortly after the government passed its much criticized austerity plan. ,1
284,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social_revolution,In libertarian socialist and anarchist parlance a social revolution is a bottom-up as opposed to a vanguard party–led or purely political revolution aiming to reorganize all of society see Spanish Revolution of 1936. In the words of Alexander Berkman social revolution means the reorganization of the industrial economic life of the country and consequently also of the entire structure of society. More generally the term social revolution may be used to refer to a massive change in society for instance the French Revolution the American Civil Rights Movement and the 1960 hippie or counterculture reformation on religious belief personal identity freedom of speech music and the arts fashion alternative technology or environmentalism and decentralised media. In the Trotskyist movement the term social revolution refers to an upheaval in which existing property relations are smashed. Examples include the October Revolution in Russia in 1917 and the Cuban Revolution as both caused capitalist and in some cases pre-capitalist property relations to turn into post-capitalist property relations as they operated by plan rather than by market. Social revolution is contrasted with purely a political revolution in which the government is replaced or the form of government altered but in which property relations are predominantly left intact. Social revolutions do not imply necessarily that the working class as a whole has control over the production and distribution of capital and goods - in many countries this control passed to a new elite in the form of a communist party - they just mean that the market is no longer used and that the capitalist class has been expropriated. In Islamic thinking especially in the Shi\a school of thought a social revolution is needed when any form of government is tyrannic and despotic to its people. The underlying concept of Islamic revolution maintains that moral freedom is the most important aspect of a human\s fundamental needs. Theda Skocpol in her article France Russia China: A Structural Analysis of Social Revolutions states that social revolution is a combination of thoroughgoing structural transformation and massive class upheavals. She comes to this definition by combining Samuel P. Huntington\s definition that it is a rapid fundamental and violent domestic change in the dominant values and myths of society in its political institutions social structure leadership and government activities and policies and Vladimir Lenin\s which is that revolutions are the festivals of the oppressed...who act] as creators of a new social order. She also states that this definition excludes many revolutions because they fail to meet either or both of the two parts of this definition. Social revolutions are distinct from coup d\etats from insurrections from mutiny and from rebellions. As Skocpol a leading figure in the literature indicates social revolutions are rare and transformative events that fundamentally alter class structures states organizations and dominant ideologies. ,1
285,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yemeni_Revolution,The Yemeni Revolution initially named the Yemeni uprising Intifada followed the initial stages of the Tunisian Revolution and occurred simultaneously with the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 and other Arab Spring protests in the Middle East and North Africa. In its early phase protests in Yemen were initially against unemployment economic conditions and corruption as well as against the government\s proposals to modify Yemen\s constitution. The protesters\ demands then escalated to calls for the resignation of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Mass defections from the military as well as from Saleh\s government effectively rendered much of the country outside of the government\s control and protesters vowed to defy its authority. A major demonstration of over 16000 protesters took place in Sana\a Yemen\s capital on 27 January. On 2 February Saleh announced he would not run for reelection in 2013 and that he would not pass power to his son. On 3 February 20000 people protested against the government in Sana\a while others protested in Aden a southern Yemeni seaport city in a Day of Rage called for by Tawakel Karman while soldiers armed members of the General People\s Congress and many protesters held a pro-government rally in Sana\a. In a Friday of Anger on 18 February tens of thousands of Yemenis took part in anti-government demonstrations in Taiz Sana\a and Aden. On a Friday of No Return on 11 March protesters called for Saleh\s ousting in Sana\a where three people were killed. More protests were held in other cities including Al Mukalla where one person was killed. On 18 March protesters in Sana\a were fired upon resulting in 52 deaths and ultimately culminating in mass defections and resignations. Starting in late April Saleh agreed to a Gulf Cooperation Council-brokered deal only to back away hours before the scheduled signing three times. After the third time on 22 May the GCC declared it was suspending its efforts to mediate in Yemen. On 23 May a day after Saleh refused to sign the transition agreement Sheikh Sadiq al-Ahmar the head of the Hashid tribal federation one of the most powerful tribes in the country declared support for the opposition and his armed supporters came into conflict with loyalist security forces in the capital Sana\a. Heavy street fighting ensued which included artillery and mortar shelling. Saleh and several others were injured and at least five people were killed by a 3 June bombing of the presidential compound when an explosion ripped through a mosque used by high-level government officials for prayer services. Reports conflicted as to whether the attack was caused by shelling or a planted bomb. The next day Vice President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi took over as acting president while Saleh flew to Saudi Arabia to be treated. The crowds celebrated Saleh\s transfer of power but Yemeni officials insisted that Saleh\s absence was temporary and he would soon return to Yemen to resume his duties of office. In early July the government rejected the opposition\s demands including the formation of a transitional council with the goal of formally transferring power from the current administration to a caretaker government intended to oversee Yemen\s first-ever democratic elections. In response factions of the opposition announced the formation of their own 17-member transitional council on 16 July though the Joint Meeting Parties that have functioned as an umbrella for many of the Yemeni opposition groups during the uprising said the council did not represent them and did not match their plan for the country. On 23 November Saleh signed a power-transfer agreement brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council in Riyadh under which he would transfer his power to his Vice-President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi within 30 days and leave his post as president by February 2012 in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Although the GCC deal was accepted by the JMP it was rejected by many of the protesters and the Houthis. A presidential election was held in Yemen on 21 February 2012 with Hadi running unopposed. A report claims that the election had a 65% turnout with Hadi receiving 99.8% of the vote. Hadi took the oath of office in Yemen\s parliament on 25 February 2012. Saleh returned home on the same day to attend Hadi\s inauguration. After months of protests Saleh had resigned from the presidency and formally transferred power to his successor marking the end of his 33-year rule. ,1

287,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Irish_revolutionary_period,For other uses see List of Irish uprisings. The revolutionary period in Irish history was the period in the 1910s and early 1920s when Irish nationalist opinion shifted from the Home Rule movement-supporting Irish Parliamentary Party to the republican Sinn Féin movement. There were several waves of civil unrest linked to Ulster loyalism trade unionism and physical force republicanism leading to the War of Independence the creation of the independent Irish Free State the Partition of Ireland and the Civil War. Modern historians define the revolutionary period as the period from 1912 or 1913 to 1923 i.e. from the introduction of the Third Home Rule Bill to the end of the Civil War or sometimes more narrowly as the period from 1916 to 1921 or 1923 i.e. from the Easter Rising to the end of the War of Independence or the Civil War. The early years of the Free State when it was governed by the pro-Treaty party Cumann na nGaedheal have been described by at least one historian as a counter-revolution. ,1

Juan Lavalle returning with the troops that fought in the Argentine-Brazilian War made a coup on December 1 1828 deposed the governor Manuel Dorrego and closed the legislature. Dorrego was captured and executed a short time afterwards. The rancher Juan Manuel de Rosas organized militias that fought against Lavalle and removed him from power restoring the legislature. However as the coup had reignited the Argentine Civil Wars Rosas was appointed governor of the Buenos Aires province to wage the war against the Unitarian League. José María Paz made from Córdoba a league of provinces and so did Rosas. The conflict ended a short time after the unexpected capture of Paz who mistook enemy troops for his own. ,1

They were led or supported by left-wing groups such as some factions of the Socialist Revolutionary Party Left Socialist Revolutionaries Mensheviks and anarchists. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued during and after the Civil War until around 1924. The Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to invite these groups to join the government and instead suppressed them with force. ,1

It involved purging Nasserist members of the government and security forces often considered pro-Soviet and left-wing and drumming up popular support by presenting the takeover as a continuation of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 while at the same time radically changing track on issues of foreign policy economy and ideology. Sadat\s Corrective Revolution also included the imprisonment of other political forces in Egypt including liberals and Islamists. ,1
291,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Export_of_revolution,Export of revolution is actions by a victorious revolutionary government of one country to promote similar revolutions in other countries as a manifestation of revolutionary internationalism of certain kind e.g. the Marxist proletarian internationalism. Fred Halliday analyzes the traits of the export of revolution by case studies of French Revolution Soviet Russia/Soviet Union Peoples Republic of China Cuba of Fidel Castro and Iran of Ayatollah Khomeini. ,1
292,http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_revolution,World revolution is the Marxist concept of overthrowing capitalism in all countries through the conscious revolutionary action of the organized working class. These revolutions would not necessarily occur simultaneously but where and when local conditions allowed a revolutionary party to successfully replace bourgeois ownership and rule and install a workers state based on social ownership of the means of production. In most Marxist schools such as Trotskyism the essentially international character of the class struggle and the necessity of global scope are critical elements and a chief explanation of the failure of socialism in one country. The end goal of such internationally oriented revolutionary socialism is to achieve world socialism and later stateless communism. ,1
293,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constituent_Assembly_of_Luxembourg,The Constituent Assembly of Luxembourg was a constituent assembly called in 1848 in Luxembourg to write and pass a new national constitution. The Grand Duchy had been administratively separate from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands since the Belgian Revolution in 1830 but remained in personal union with the Netherlands. The first constitution had been passed in 1841 under William II but it was a very conservative document affirming the autocracy of the King-Grand Duke. With the outbreak of the Revolutions of 1848 William changed from a conservative to a liberal allowing for the preservation of the monarchy in the face of an upsurge in liberal sympathies. On 24 March a Grand Ducal decree called for the establishment a commission of fifteen to investigate how to preserve the government. On 30 March they agreed by thirteen votes to none with two abstentions to call a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution and this was accepted by the King-Grand Duke on 1 April. Elections to the assembly were held on 19 April 1848. The assembly met for the first time on 25 April in the temporary seat of government Ettelbruck as Luxembourg City was deemed too dangerous in the revolutionary atmosphere. On 29 April they moved back to Luxembourg City using the recently constructed Luxembourg City Hall. The assembly adopted a constitution on 23 June and it was given consent by the King-Grand Duke on 10 July. The constitution adopted was similar to the liberal constitution of Belgium which had been written by the National Congress during the Belgian Revolution. The only substantive difference was the non-inclusion of a senate which the King-Grand Duke urged to check the power of the new Chamber of Deputies. A senate the Council of State would eventually be created in 1856 with William III handing down a new conservative constitution against the wishes of the Chamber. The constitution entered into force on 1 August 1848 with a new government under the former governor Gaspard-Théodore-Ignace de la Fontaine taking office until elections could be held to the first Chamber of Deputies. These were held on 28 September 1848. The Chamber took session on 3 October and a new permanent government under Jean-Jacques Willmar took office on 8 December 1848 completing the promulgation of the constitution. ,1
294,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canut_revolts,Major revolts by silk workers in Lyon in France known collectively as the Canut revolts French: Révolte des canuts occurred in 1831 1834 and 1848. They were among the first well-defined worker uprisings of the period known as the Industrial Revolution. The word Canut was a common term to describe to all Lyonnais silk workers. The First Canut revolt in 1831 was provoked by a bad economy and a resultant drop in silk prices which caused a drop in workers wages. In an effort to maintain their standard of living the workers tried to see a minimum price imposed on silk. The refusal of the manufacturers to pay this price infuriated the workers who went into open revolt. They seized the arsenal and repulsed the local national guard and military in a bloody battle which left the insurgents in control of the town. The government sent Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars at the head of an army of 20000 to restore order. Soult was able to retake the town without any bloodshed and without making any compromises with the workers. Though some workers were arrested all were eventually acquitted. The revolt ended with the minimum price abolished and with the workers no better off. The Second Canut revolt in 1834 occurred in a prosperous economy that had caused a surge in workers wages. Owners saw these wages as too high so they attempted to impose a wage decrease. This combined with laws that oppressed Republican groups caused the workers to rebel. The government crushed the rebellion in a bloody battle and deported or imprisoned 10000 insurgents. A third insurrection occurred in 1848. Although it was as violent and was motivated by almost identical worker exploitation 1848 was a year of revolution all over Europe and it did not acquire the same renown as that of 1831. Indeed the revolt of 1831 encouraged many other worker revolts of the 19th century. ,1
295,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Revolutions_of_1848,The Revolutions of 1848 known in some countries as the Spring of Nations Peoples Spring Springtime of the Peoples or the Year of Revolution were a series of political upheavals throughout Europe in 1848. It remains the most widespread revolutionary wave in European history. The revolutions were essentially democratic in nature with the aim of removing the old feudal structures and creating independent national states. The revolutionary wave began in France in February and immediately spread to most of Europe and parts of Latin America. Over 50 countries were affected but with no coordination or cooperation between their respective revolutionaries. According to Evans and von Strandmann 2000 some of the major contributing factors were widespread dissatisfaction with political leadership demands for more participation in government and democracy demands for freedom of press other demands made by the working class the upsurge of nationalism and the regrouping of established governmental forces. The uprisings were led by shaky ad hoc coalitions of reformers the middle classes and workers which did not hold together for long. Tens of thousands of people were killed and many more forced into exile. Significant lasting reforms included the abolition of serfdom in Austria and Hungary the end of absolute monarchy in Denmark and the introduction of parliamentary democracy in the Netherlands. The revolutions were most important in France the Netherlands the nations that would make up the German Empire in the late 19th century and early 20th Italy and the Austrian Empire. ,1
296,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Second_EDSA_Revolution,The Second EDSA Revolution EDSA II was a four-day political protest from 17–20 January 2001 that peacefully overthrew the government of Joseph Estrada the thirteenth President of the Philippines. Estrada was succeeded by his Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo who was sworn into office by then-Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr. at around noon on January 20 2001 several hours before Estrada fled Malacañang Palace. EDSA is an acronym derived from Epifanio de los Santos Avenue the major thoroughfare connecting five cities in Metro Manila namely Pasay Makati Mandaluyong Quezon City and Caloocan with the revolution\s epicentre at the EDSA Shrine church at the northern tip of Ortigas Center a business district. Advocates described EDSA II as popular but critics view the uprising as a conspiracy among political and business elites military top brass and Catholic Cardinal Jaime Sin. International reaction to the revolt was mixed with some foreign nations including the United States immediately recognising the legitimacy of Arroyo\s presidency and foreign commentators describing it as a defeat for due process of law mob rule and a de facto coup. The only means of legitimizing the event was the last-minute Supreme Court ruling that the welfare of the people is the supreme law. But by then the Armed Forces of the Philippines had already withdrawn support for the president which some analysts called unconstitutional and most foreign political analysts agreeing with this assessment. William Overholt a Hong Kong-based political economist said that It is either being called mob rule or mob rule as a cover for a well-planned coup ... but either way it\s not democracy. It should also be noted that opinion was divided during EDSA II about whether Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as the incumbent Vice President should be President if Joseph Estrada was ousted; many groups who participated in EDSA II expressly stated that they did not want Arroyo for president either and some of them would later participate in EDSA III. The prevailing Constitution of the Philippines calls for the Vice President of the Philippines Arroyo at the time to act as interim president only when the sitting President dies resigns or becomes incapacitated none of which occurred during EDSA II. On October 4 2000 Ilocos Sur Governor Luis Chavit Singson a longtime friend of President Joseph Estrada went public with accusations that Estrada his family and friends received millions of pesos from operations of the illegal numbers game jueteng. The exposé immediately ignited reactions of rage. The next day Senate Minority Leader Teofisto Guingona Jr. delivered a fiery privilege speech accusing Estrada of receiving P220 million in jueteng money from Governor Singson from November 1998 to August 2000 as well as taking P70 million on excise tax on cigarettes intended for Ilocos Sur. The privilege speech was referred by Senate President Franklin Drilon to the Blue Ribbon Committee and the Committee on Justice for joint investigation. Another committee in the House of Representatives decided to investigate the exposé while other house members spearheaded a move to impeach the president. More calls for resignation came from Manila Cardinal Archbishop Jaime Sin the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines former Presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos and Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo who had resigned her cabinet position of Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development. Cardinal Sin stated in a statement In the light of the scandals that besmirched the image of presidency in the last two years we stand by our conviction that he has lost the moral authority to govern. More resignations came from Estrada\s cabinet and economic advisers and other members of congress defected from his ruling party. On November 13 2000 the House of Representatives led by Speaker Manuel Villar transmitted the Articles of Impeachment signed by 115 representatives to the Senate. This caused shakeups in the leadership of both houses of congress. The impeachment trial was formally opened on November 20 with twenty-one senators taking their oaths as judges and Supreme Court Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr. presiding. The trial began on December 7. The day-to-day trial was covered on live Philippine television and received the highest viewing rating at the time. Among the highlights of the trial was the testimony of Clarissa Ocampo senior vice president of Equitable PCI Bank who testified that she was one foot away from Estrada when he signed the name Jose Velarde documents involving a P500 million investment agreement with their bank in February 2000. ,1
297,http://dbpedia.org/resource/June_Democratic_Uprising,The June Democratic Uprising Hangul: 6월 민주항쟁 Hanja: 6月民主運動 also known as the June Democracy Movement was a nationwide democracy movement in South Korea that generated mass protests from June 10 to June 29 1987. The demonstrations forced the ruling government to hold elections and institute other democratic reforms which led to the establishment of the Sixth Republic the present day government of South Korea. On June 10th the military regime of President Chun Doo-hwan announced its choice of Roh Tae Woo as the next president. The public designation of Chuns successor was seen as a final affront to a delayed and deferred process to revise the South Korean constitution to permit direct election of the President. Although pressure on the regime in the form of demonstrations by students and other groups had been building for some time the announcement finally triggered massive and effective protests.

298,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wallachian_Revolution_of_1848,The Wallachian Revolution of 1848 was a Romanian liberal and nationalist uprising in the Principality of Wallachia. Part of the Revolutions of 1848 and closely connected with the unsuccessful revolt in the Principality of Moldavia it sought to overturn the administration imposed by Imperial Russian authorities under the Regulamentul Organic regime and through many of its leaders demanded the abolition of boyar privilege. Led by a group of young intellectuals and officers in the Wallachian Militia the movement succeeded in toppling the ruling Prince Gheorghe Bibescu whom it replaced with a Provisional Government and a Regency and in passing a series of major progressive reforms first announced in the Proclamation of Islaz. Despite its rapid gains and popular backing the new administration was marked by conflicts between the radical wing and more conservative forces especially over the issue of land reform. Two successive abortive coups were able to weaken the Government and its international status was always contested by Russia. After managing to rally a degree of sympathy from Ottoman political leaders the Revolution was ultimately isolated by the intervention of Russian diplomats and ultimately repressed by a common intervention of Ottoman and Russian armies without any significant form of armed resistance. Nevertheless over the following decade the completion of its goals was made possible by the international context and former revolutionaries became the original political class in united Romania. ,1

301,http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Workshops,National Workshops French: Ateliers Nationaux refer to areas of work provided for the unemployed by the French Second Republic after the Revolution of 1848. The political crisis which resulted in the abdication of Louis Philippe caused an acute industrial crisis adding to the general agricultural and commercial distress which had prevailed throughout 1847. It rendered the problem of unemployment in Paris very acute. The provisional government under the influence of one of its members Louis Blanc passed a decree 25 February 1848 guaranteeing government-funded jobs. The following is an extract: The provisional government of the French Republic undertakes to guarantee the existence of the workmen by work. It undertakes to guarantee work for every citizen. For the carrying out of this decree Louis Blanc wanted the formation of a ministry of labor but this was shelved by his colleagues who as a compromise appointed a government labor Commission under the presidency of Louis Blanc with power of inquiry and consultation only. The carrying out of the decree of February trusted to the minister of public works M. Marie and various public works were immediately started. The earlier stages of the national works prompted the following account: The workman first of all obtained a certificate from the landlord of his house or furnished apartments showing his address whether in Paris or the department of the Seine. This certificate was visad and stamped by the police commissary of the district. The workman then repaired to the office of the maire of his ward and on delivering this document received in exchange a note of admission to the national works bearing his name residence and calling and enabling him to be received by the director of the workplaces in which vacancies existed. All went well while the number of the unemployed was less than 6000 but as soon as that number was exceeded the workmen of each arrondissement after having visited all the open works in succession without result returned to their maires offices tired starving and discontented. ,1

At its height the movement controlled a theocratic state in the Hanzhong valley north of Sichuan. In 215 CE the state was incorporated into Cao Caos Kingdom of Wei and the followers of the Celestial Master were dispersed all over China. The Celestial Masters believed that qi pervaded everything and in order to achieve immortality the correct balance of qi had to be present within the body. Having a poor quantity of qi in the body would result in illness and eventually death. Meditation could be used to restore qi to the body but sex was to be avoided as it could result in the loss of qi. If there was the correct balance of qi within the body upon death an adherent could feign death and be reborn. If not an adherent would be transported to an earthly prison where he would face eternal torment. The Hanzhong state was divided into 24 regions which were led by an official. Each district had a civil register which recorded peoples names and ranks. Three times a year the registers were updated at the same time as an important feast. While a childs rank rose automatically adults had to raise their own rank through religious achievement or marriage. Higher ranked people had more divine generals at their command which could be used to fight demons that caused bad luck or disease. The state had a system of law that encouraged confession and benevolence rather than strict punishment. Criminals were asked to confess their crimes and meditate and were given public work to do as a sentence. Few texts written by the Hanzhong Celestial Masters survive with the most important being the Xianger commentary to the Dao De Jing. While the Hanzhong state lasted for only twenty-five years their beliefs influenced all subsequent Daoist movements. ,1

The most salient complaint was against the governments quartering of soldiers. Other issues of contention were tax protests and Catalan nationalistic tensions. The revolt was funded and intensified by agents of France as part of the War of the Grand Alliance. Civil disorder lasted from 1687 to 1689. Support for the revolt was concentrated in rural areas particularly the poor. The only members of the elite who supported the revolt were wealthy commoners from the countryside.

305,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1970s_peasant_revolts_in_Thailand,Thailand witnessed several uprisings by farmers from several central Thai provinces in the mid-1970s. Thailand transitioning to democratic government after nearly forty years of dictatorship was beset by revolution involving several segments of the population. Farmers were one of several politicized groups that rioted on the streets. They implored for the Thai Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn to reduce their debt and to ensure fair rice prices. These appeals were ignored with the prime minister refusing to meet with farmers. In their desperation farmers tried to enact change by themselves. Unafraid of creditors and other capitalists they hoped for a change which would free them from debt-bondage. They announced their intention to cease paying taxes and refused to recognise the authority of Thai state leadership. By setting up an autonomous liberated zone the farmers sought greater freedom and the ability to better influence rice crop prices in order to better sustain themselves. The aims of the farmers revolt were to be recognised for their contributions to the state and subsequently to be treated with respect equal to that of their landlords. From the revolt the Farmers Federation of Thailand FFT a national autonomous Thai farmers organisation emerged. The FFT led the struggle in northern Thailand to pass a law which standardised and lowered the level of rents on rice land the Land Rent Control Act LRCA of December 1974. What followed in the wake of the 14 October 1973 movement were mass protests by farmers and their allies such as students and professional classes who challenged the ruling elite to improve the lives of farmers. The revolt antagonized landowners and state officials. In response activists were harassed and worse was to follow. Between March 1974 and September 1979 21 FTT leaders were assassinated with the killings concentrated in the Chiang Mai region. The assassination of FTT leaders created an environment of pervasive fear in the countryside and ended the revolutionary efforts of the FTT. ,1
306,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989,The Tiananmen Square protests commonly known in Chinese as the June Fourth Incident 六四事件 were student-led demonstrations in Beijing in 1989. More broadly it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period sometimes referred to as the  89 Democracy Movement 八九民运. The protests were forcibly suppressed after the government declared martial law. In what became widely known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre troops with assault rifles and tanks killed at least several hundred demonstrators trying to block the militarys advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths has been estimated at anywhere between the hundreds to the thousands. Set against a backdrop of rapid economic and social changes in post Mao-era China the protests reflected anxieties about the countrys future in the popular consciousness and among the political elite. The reforms of the 1980s had led a nascent market economy which benefited some groups but seriously disaffected others; the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy and restrictions on political participation. The students drew upon Western-inspired ideals and called for democracy greater accountability freedom of the press and freedom of speech though they were loosely organized and their goals varied. At the height of the protests about a million people assembled in the Square. As the protests developed the authorities veered back and forth between conciliatory and hardline tactics exposing deep divisions within the party leadership. By May a student-led hunger strike galvanized support for the demonstrators around the country and the protests spread to some 400 cities. Ultimately Chinas paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and other party elders believed the protests to be a political threat and resolved to use force. Party authorities declared martial law on May 20 and mobilized as many as 300000 troops to Beijing. The Chinese government was widely condemned internationally for the use of force. Western countries imposed economic sanctions and arms embargoes. The Chinese government initially condemned the protests as a counter-revolutionary riot. In the aftermath of the crackdown the government conducted widespread arrests of protesters and their supporters suppressed other protests around China expelled foreign journalists and strictly controlled coverage of the events in the domestic press. The police and internal security forces were strengthened. Officials deemed sympathetic to the protests were demoted or purged. More broadly the suppression temporarily halted the policies of liberalization in the 1980s. Considered a watershed event the protests also set the limits on political expression in China well into the 21st century. Its memory is widely associated with questioning the legitimacy of Communist Party rule and remains one of the most sensitive and most widely censored political topics on mainland China. ,1
307,http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Agricultural_Revolution,The British Agricultural Revolution was the unprecedented increase in agricultural production in Britain due to increases in labour and land productivity between the mid-17th and late 19th centuries. Agricultural output grew faster than the population over the century to 1770 and thereafter productivity remained among the highest in the world. This increase in the food supply contributed to the rapid growth of population in England and Wales from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801 though domestic production gave way increasingly to food imports in the nineteenth century as population more than tripled to over 32 million. The rise in productivity accelerated the decline of the agricultural share of the labour force adding to the urban workforce on which industrialization depended: the Agricultural Revolution has therefore been cited as a cause of the Industrial Revolution. However historians continue to dispute when exactly such a revolution took place and of what it consisted. Rather than a single event G.E. Mingay states that there were a profusion of agricultural revolutions one for two centuries before 1750 another emphasising the century after 1650 a third for the period 1750-1880 and a fourth for the middle decades of the nineteenth century. This has led more recent historians to argue that any general statements about the Agricultural Revolution are difficult to sustain. One important change in farming methods was the move in crop rotation to turnips and clover in place of fallow. Turnips can be grown in winter and are deep rooted allowing them to gather minerals unavailable to shallow rooted crops. Clover fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form of fertiliser. This permitted the intensive arable cultivation of light soils on enclosed farms and provided fodder to support increased livestock numbers whose manure added further to soil fertility. ,1

Following the defeat of Emperor Napoleon III in September 1870 the French Second Empire swiftly collapsed. In its stead rose a Third Republic at war with Prussia which laid siege to Paris for four months. A hotbed of working-class radicalism France\s capital was primarily defended during this time by the often politicized and radical troops of the National Guard rather than regular Army troops. In February 1871 Adolphe Thiers the new chief executive of the French national government signed an armistice with Prussia that disarmed the Army but not the National Guard. Soldiers of the Commune\s National Guard killed two French army generals; and the Commune refused to accept the authority of the French government. The regular French Army suppressed the Commune during La semaine sanglante The Bloody Week beginning on 21 May 1871. Debates over the policies and outcome of the Commune had significant influence on the ideas of Karl Marx who described it as an example of the dictatorship of the proletariat. ,1

An important decolonization war it was a complex conflict characterized by guerrilla warfare maquis fighting and the use of torture by both sides. The conflict was also a civil war between loyalist Algerians supporting a French Algeria and their Algerian nationalist counterparts. Effectively started by members of the National Liberation Front FLN on November 1 1954 during the Toussaint Rouge Red All Saints\ Day the conflict shook the foundations of the weak and unstable Fourth French Republic 1946–58 and led to its replacement by the Fifth Republic with a strengthened Presidency with Charles de Gaulle acting in the latter role. Although the military campaigns greatly weakened the FLN militarily with most prominent FLN leaders killed or arrested and terror attacks effectively stopped the brutality of the methods employed failed to win hearts and minds in Algeria alienated support in Metropolitan France and discredited French prestige abroad. After major demonstrations in favor of independence from the end of 1960  and a United Nations resolution recognizing the right to independence De Gaulle decided to open a series of negotiations with the FLN which was concluded with the signing of the Évian Accords on March 1962. A referendum was held on 8 April 1962 and the French electorate approved the Évian Accords. The final result was 91% in favor of the ratification of this agreement  and on 1 July the Accords were subject to a second referendum in Algeria where with 99.72% voted for independence and just 0.28% against. The planned withdrawal led to a state crisis to various assassination attempts on de Gaulle and to some attempts at military coups. Most of the former were carried out by the Organisation de l\armée secrète OAS an underground organization formed mainly from French military personnel supporting a French Algeria which committed a large number of bombings and murders in both Algeria and the homeland to stop the planned independence. Upon independence in 1962 900000 European-Algerians Pieds-noirs fled to France in fear of the FLN\s revenge within a few months. The government was totally unprepared for the vast number of refugees causing turmoil in France. The majority of Algerian Muslims who had worked for the French were disarmed and left behind as the treaty between French and Algerian authorities declared that no actions could be taken against them. However the Harkis in particular having served as auxiliaries with the French army were regarded as traitors by the FLN and between 50000 and 150000 Harkis and family members were murdered by the FLN or lynch-mobs often after being abducted and tortured. About 91000 managed to flee to France some with help from their French officers acting against orders and today they and their descendants form a significant part of the Algerian-French population. ,1

It was initiated by the Militia United in Righteousness Yihetuan known in English as the Boxers and was motivated by proto-nationalist sentiments and opposition to imperialist expansion and associated Christian missionary activity. The uprising took place against a background of severe drought and the disruption caused by the growth of foreign spheres of influence. After several months of growing violence against the foreign and Christian presence in Shandong and the North China plain in June 1900 Boxer fighters convinced they were invulnerable to foreign weapons converged on Beijing with the slogan Support Qing government and exterminate the foreigners. Foreigners and Chinese Christians sought refuge in the Legation Quarter. In response to reports of an armed invasion to lift the siege the initially hesitant Empress Dowager Cixi supported the Boxers and on June 21 issued an Imperial Decree declaring war on the foreign powers. Diplomats foreign civilians and soldiers as well as Chinese Christians in the Legation Quarter were placed under siege by the Imperial Army of China and the Boxers for 55 days. Chinese officialdom was split between those supporting the Boxers and those favoring conciliation led by Prince Qing. The supreme commander of the Chinese forces the Manchu General Ronglu Junglu later claimed that he acted to protect the besieged foreigners. The Eight-Nation Alliance after being initially turned back brought 20000 armed troops to China defeated the Imperial Army and captured Beijing on August 14 lifting the siege of the Legations. Uncontrolled plunder of the capital and the surrounding countryside ensued along with the summary execution of those suspected of being Boxers. The Boxer Protocol of 7 September 1901 provided for the execution of government officials who had supported the Boxers provisions for foreign troops to be stationed in Beijing and 450 million taels of silver—more than the government\s annual tax revenue—to be paid as indemnity over the course of the next thirty-nine years to the eight nations involved. ,1

The end of the unification process is officially referred to as German unity German: Deutsche Einheit celebrated on 3 October German Unity Day German: Tag der deutschen Einheit. Following German reunification Berlin was once again designated as the capital of united Germany. The East German regime started to falter in May 1989 when the removal of Hungary\s border fence with Austria opened a hole in the Iron Curtain. It caused an exodus of thousands of East Germans fleeing to West Germany and Austria via Hungary. The Peaceful Revolution a series of protests by East Germans led to the GDR\s first free elections on 18 March 1990 and to the negotiations between the GDR and FRG that culminated in a Unification Treaty. Other negotiations between the GDR and FRG and the four occupying powers produced the so-called Two Plus Four Treaty Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany granting full sovereignty to a unified German state whose two parts had previously still been bound by a number of limitations stemming from their post-World War II status as occupied regions.

316,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spanish_Revolution_of_1936,The Spanish Revolution was a workers\ social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organizational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily Catalonia Aragon Andalusia and parts of the Valencian Community. Much of the economy of Spain was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia the figure was as high as 75% but lower in areas with heavy influence by the Communist Party of Spain. Factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivized and run as libertarian socialist communes. Even places like hotels barber shops and restaurants were collectivized and managed by their workers. Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution which he claimed came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history. Dolgoff quotes the French anarchist historian Gaston Leval who was an active participant to summarize the anarchist conception of the social revolution: In Spain during almost three years despite a civil war that took a million lives despite the opposition of the political parties republicans left and right Catalan separatists socialists Communists Basque and Valencian regionalists petty bourgeoisie etc. this idea of libertarian communism was put into effect. Very quickly more than 60% of the land was collectively cultivated by the peasants themselves without landlords without bosses and without instituting capitalist competition to spur production. In almost all the industries factories mills workshops transportation services public services and utilities the rank and file workers their revolutionary committees and their syndicates reorganized and administered production distribution and public services without capitalists high salaried managers or the authority of the state. Even more: the various agrarian and industrial collectives immediately instituted economic equality in accordance with the essential principle of communism \From each according to his ability and to each according to his needs.\ They coordinated their efforts through free association in whole regions created new wealth increased production especially in agriculture built more schools and bettered public services. They instituted not bourgeois formal democracy but genuine grass roots functional libertarian democracy where each individual participated directly in the revolutionary reorganization of social life. They replaced the war between men \survival of the fittest\ by the universal practice of mutual aid and replaced rivalry by the principle of solidarity.... This experience in which about eight million people directly or indirectly participated opened a new way of life to those who sought an alternative to anti-social capitalism on the one hand and totalitarian state bogus socialism on the other. The collectivization effort was primarily orchestrated by the rank-and-file members of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo CNT; English: National Confederation of Labor and the Federación Anarquista Ibérica FAI; English: Iberian Anarchist Federation with the two often abbreviated as CNT–FAI due to the affinity between the two organizations and the major role of the latter within the former in maintaining anarchist purity.

The struggle was complicated by the influence and actions of the allies of the two warring sides. Peoples Army of Vietnam North Vietnamese Army involvement was designed to protect its Base Areas and sanctuaries in eastern Cambodia without which the prosecution of its military effort in South Vietnam would have been more difficult. The Cambodian coup of 18 March 1970 put a pro-American anti-Vietnamese government in power and ended Cambodias neutrality in the Vietnam War. The North Vietnamese Army PAVN was now threatened by a newly unfriendly Cambodian government. Between March and June 1970 the North Vietnamese moved many of its military installations further inside Cambodia to protect them from U.S. incursions and bombing capturing most of the northeastern third of the country in engagements with the Cambodian army. The North Vietnamese turned over some of their conquests and provided other assistance to the Khmer Rouge thus empowering what was at the time a small guerilla movement. The Cambodian government hastened to expand its army to combat the North Vietnamese and the growing threat of the Khmer Rouge. The U.S. was motivated by the desire to buy time for its withdrawal from Southeast Asia to protect its ally in South Vietnam and to prevent the spread of communism to Cambodia. American and both South and North Vietnamese forces directly participated at one time or another in the fighting. The U.S. assisted the central government with massive U.S. aerial bombing campaigns and direct material and financial aid. After five years of savage fighting the Republican government was defeated on 17 April 1975 when the victorious Khmer Rouge proclaimed the establishment of Democratic Kampuchea. The conflict was part of the Second Indochina War 1959–1975 which also consumed the neighboring Kingdom of Laos South Vietnam and North Vietnam individually referred to as the Laotian Civil War and the Vietnam War respectively.

Demonstrations against the Shah commenced in October 1977 developing into a campaign of civil resistance that included both secular and religious elements and which intensified in January 1978. Between August and December 1978 strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the country. The Shah left Iran for exile on January 16 1979 as the last Persian monarch leaving his duties to a regency council and an opposition-based prime minister. Ayatollah Khomeini was invited back to Iran by the government and returned to Tehran to a greeting by several million Iranians. The royal reign collapsed shortly after on February 11 when guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting bringing Khomeini to official power. Iran voted by national referendum to become an Islamic Republic on April 1 1979 and to approve a new theocratic-republican constitution whereby Khomeini became Supreme Leader of the country in December 1979. The revolution was unusual for the surprise it created throughout the world: it lacked many of the customary causes of revolution defeat at war a financial crisis peasant rebellion or disgruntled military occurred in a nation that was enjoying relative prosperity produced profound change at great speed was massively popular resulted in the exile of many Iranians and replaced a pro-Western semi-absolute monarchy with an anti-Western authoritarian theocracy based on the concept of Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists or velayat-e faqih. It was a relatively non-violent revolution and helped to redefine the meaning and practice of modern revolutions although there was violence in its aftermath. Its outcome – an Islamic Republic under the guidance of a religious scholar from Qom – was as one scholar put it clearly an occurrence that had to be explained. ,1

It ensued after seven Catholic cantons formed the Sonderbund separate alliance in 1845 to protect their interests against a centralization of power. The war concluded with the defeat of the Sonderbund. It resulted in the emergence of Switzerland as a federal state concluding the period of political restoration and regeneration in Switzerland. The Sonderbund consisted of the cantons of Lucerne Fribourg Valais Uri Schwyz Unterwalden and Zug all predominantly Catholic and governed by Conservative administrations. The cantons of Ticino and Solothurn also predominantly Catholic but governed by liberal administrations did not join the alliance. After the Tagsatzung Federal Diet declared the Sonderbund unconstitutional and ordered it dissolved by force General Guillaume-Henri Dufour led the federal army of 100000 and defeated the Sonderbund under Johann-Ulrich von Salis-Soglio in a campaign that lasted only a few weeks from November 3 to November 29 and claimed fewer than a hundred lives. He ordered his troops to care for the injured anticipating the formation of the Red Cross in which he participated a few years later. Major actions were fought at Fribourg Geltwil Lunnern Lucerne and finally at Gisikon Meierskappel and Schüpfheim after which Lucerne capitulated on 24 November.

326,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counter-revolutionary,A counter-revolutionary is anyone who opposes a revolution particularly those who act after a revolution to try to overturn or reverse it in full or in part. The adjective counter-revolutionary pertains to movements that would restore the state of affairs or the principles that prevailed during a prerevolutionary era. A counter-revolution can be positive or negative in its consequences; depending in part on the beneficent or pernicious character of the revolution that gets reversed. For example the transitory success of Agis and Cleomenes of ancient Sparta in restoring the constitution of Lycurgus was considered by Plutarch to be counter-revolutionary in a positive sense. During the French Revolution the Jacobins saw the Counter-revolution in the Vendée as distinctly negative. ,1
327,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blanquism,Blanquism refers to a conception of revolution generally attributed to Louis Auguste Blanqui 1805–1881 which holds that socialist revolution should be carried out by a relatively small group of highly organised and secretive conspirators. Having seized power the revolutionaries would then use the power of the state to introduce socialism. It is considered a particular sort of putschism – that is the view that political revolution should take the form of a putsch or coup détat. Blanquism is distinguished from other socialist currents especially Marxist ones in various ways; on the one hand contrary to Marx Blanqui did not believe in the predominant role of the working class nor did he believe in popular movements. Instead he believed that revolution should be carried out by a small group of professional dedicated revolutionaries who would establish a temporary dictatorship by force. This dictatorship would permit the implementation of the basis of a new order after which power would then be handed to the people. In another respect Blanqui was more concerned with the revolution itself rather than the future society that would result from it; if his thought was based on precise socialist principles it rarely goes so far as to imagine a purely socialist society. For Blanquists the overturning of the bourgeois social order and the revolution are ends sufficient in themselves at least for their immediate purposes. He was one of the non-Marxist socialists of his day. ,1

The uprising was marked by massive anti-government opposition demonstrations against the Baathist government of Bashar al-Assad meeting with police and military violence massive arrests and brutal crackdown resulting in hundreds of casualties and thousands of wounded. Despite Bashar al-Assads attempts to pacify the protests with massive crackdown and use of censorship on one hand and concessions on the other by the end of April it became clear the situation was getting out of his control and the Syrian government deployed numerous troops on the ground. The civil uprising phase created the platform for emergence of militant opposition movements and massive defections from the Syrian Army which gradually transformed the conflict from a civil uprising to an armed rebellion and later a civil war. The rebel Free Syrian Army was created on July 29 2011. ,1

The revolution led to the establishment of a parliament in Persia Iran during the Qajar Dynasty. The Revolution opened the way for cataclysmic change in Persia heralding the modern era. It saw a period of unprecedented debate in a burgeoning press. The revolution created new opportunities and opened up seemingly boundless possibilities for Persia’s future. Many different groups fought to shape the course of the Revolution and all sections of society were ultimately to be in some way changed by it. The old order which king Nasser-al-Din Shah Qajar had struggled for so long to sustain finally died to be replaced by new institutions new forms of expression and a new social and political order. The monarch Mozaffar ad-Din Shah signed the constitution in 1906 but he died shortly after and was replaced by Mohammad Ali Shah. The latter abolished the constitution and bombarded the parliament with Russian and British support in 1908. This led to another pro-constitutional movement. The constitutionalist forces marched to Tehran forced Muhammad Ali Shahs abdication in favor of his young son Ahmad Shah Qajar and the re-established the constitution in 1909. On December 12 1925 Irans parliament amended Irans constitution of 1906–1907 to replace the Qajar dynasty 1797–1925 with the Pahlavi dynasty as the legitimate sovereigns of Iran.

The main claim for the quantitative revolution is that it led to a shift from a descriptive idiographic geography to an empirical law-making nomothetic geography. The quantitative revolution occurred during the 1950s and 1960s and marked a rapid change in the method behind geographical research from regional geography into a spatial science. The quantitative revolution had occurred earlier in economics and psychology and contemporaneously in political science and other social sciences and to a lesser extent in history. ,1
335,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Revolutionary_breach_of_legal_continuity,Revolutionary breach of legal continuity is a concept in English constitutional law which rationalises the historic English behaviour when one King or regime was deposed and a de facto ruler was recognised as the new de jure monarch or republican authority. More generally it is any process unauthorised by an existing legal order which results in the creation of a new legal order; whether or not the revolutionary change is brought about by violence. The most recent successful revolutionary breach in England and Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland was the Glorious Revolution of 1688-1689 which replaced King James II of England and Ireland King James VII of Scotland with the joint sovereignty of his son-in-law King William III of England King William II of Scotland and daughter Queen Mary II of England and Scotland. The United States Declaration of Independence is another example as it had no basis in the previous legal order which had governed the thirteen colonies and represented the start of a new legal order. There was an attempted revolutionary breach in the whole of Ireland in 1919 when the First Dáil a gathering of persons elected to the United Kingdom House of Commons in 1918 declared an Irish Republic without any authority to do so within the terms of the United Kingdoms legal order. The subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty and steps taken under it gave the Irish Free State legitimacy within the United Kingdom legal order but they delegitimised it for those who regarded the applicable legal order to be that proclaimed in 1919. When the present constitution of Ireland was adopted the amending formula of the Irish Free State constitution was not used so the new constitution would represent a revolutionary breach and derive its legitimacy from purely Irish sources. Similar steps were taken so the Indian people became the source of legitimacy for the republican constitution of India. The republican constitution replaced the one authorised by the United Kingdom at the time of independence but did not comply with its provisions for amendments. The term has also been applied to regime change following a military coup in Commonwealth of Nations members such as Pakistan and Nigeria. ,1

338,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spanish_American_wars_of_independence,The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century after the French invasion of Spain during Europes Napoleonic Wars. These conflicts started in 1809 with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville. When the Central Junta fell to the French invasion in 1810 numerous new juntas appeared across the Spanish domains in the Americas. The conflicts among these colonies and with Spain eventually resulted in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south to Mexico in the north in the first third of the 19th century. Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule until the Spanish–American War in 1898. The new republics from the beginning abolished the casta system the Inquisition and nobility and slavery was ended in all of the new nations within a quarter century. Criollos those of Spanish descent born in the New World and mestizos those Indian mixed with Spanish blood or culture replaced Spanish-born appointees in most political offices. Criollos remained at the top of a social structure which retained some of its traditional features culturally if not legally. For almost a century thereafter conservatives and liberals fought to reverse or to deepen the social and political changes unleashed by those rebellions. These conflicts were fought as irregular warfare and conventional warfare and both wars of national liberation and civil wars since on the one hand the goal of one group of belligerents was the independence of the Spanish colonies and on the other the majority of combatants on both sides were Spanish Americans and indigenous people not Spaniards. Both armies originated from Spanish colonial troops of Americas. While some Spanish Americans believed that independence was necessary most who initially supported the creation of the new governments saw them as a means to preserve the regions autonomy from the French. Over the course of the next decade the political instability in Spain and the absolutist restoration under Ferdinand VII convinced more and more Spanish Americans of the need to formally establish independence from the mother country. The events in Spanish America were related to the other wars of independence in Haiti and Brazil. Brazils independence in particular shared a common starting point with Spanish Americas since both conflicts were triggered by Napoleons invasion of the Iberian Peninsula which forced the Portuguese royal family to resettle in Brazil in 1807. The process of Latin American independence took place in the general political and intellectual climate that emerged from the Age of Enlightenment and that influenced all of the Atlantic Revolutions including the earlier revolutions in the United States and France. A more direct cause of the Spanish American wars of independence were the unique developments occurring within the Kingdom of Spain and its monarchy during this period. ,1

350,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_War_of_Independence,The Greek War of Independence also known as the Greek Revolution Greek: Ελληνική Επανάσταση Elliniki Epanastasi; Ottoman: يونان عصياني Yunan İsyanı Greek Uprising was a successful war of independence waged by the Greek revolutionaries between 1821 and 1832 against the Ottoman Empire. The Greeks were later assisted by the Russian Empire Great Britain the Kingdom of France and several other European powers while the Ottomans were aided by their vassals the eyalets of Egypt Algeria and Tripolitania and the Beylik of Tunis. Even several decades before the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 most of Greece had come under Ottoman rule. During this time there were several revolt attempts by Greeks to gain independence from Ottoman control. In 1814 a secret organization called the Filiki Eteria was founded with the aim of liberating Greece. The Filiki Eteria planned to launch revolts in the Peloponnese the Danubian Principalities and in Constantinople and its surrounding areas. The first of these revolts began on 6 March 1821 in the Danubian Principalities but it was soon put down by the Ottomans. The events in the north urged the Greeks in the Peloponnese into action and on 17 March 1821 the Maniots declared war on the Ottomans. This declaration was the start of a spring of revolutionary actions from other controlled states against the Ottoman Empire. By the end of the month the Peloponnese was in open revolt against the Turks and by October 1821 the Greeks under Theodoros Kolokotronis had captured Tripolitsa. The Peloponnesian revolt was quickly followed by revolts in Crete Macedonia and Central Greece which would soon be suppressed. Meanwhile the makeshift Greek navy was achieving success against the Ottoman navy in the Aegean Sea and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea. Tensions soon developed among different Greek factions leading to two consecutive civil wars. In the meantime the Ottoman Sultan negotiated with Mehmet Ali of Egypt who agreed to send his son Ibrahim Pasha to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gain. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and had immediate success: by the end of 1825 most of the Peloponnese was under Egyptian control and the city of Missolonghi fell in April 1826 after a year-long siege by the Turks. Although Ibrahim was defeated in Mani he had succeeded in suppressing most of the revolt in the Peloponnese and Athens had been retaken. Following years of negotiation three Great Powers—Russia Britain and France—decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to Greece. Following news that combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleets were going to attack the Greek island of Hydra the allied fleet intercepted the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet at Navarino. The battle began after a tense week-long standoff ending in the destruction of the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet. By 1828 the Egyptian army withdrew under pressure of a French expeditionary force to which the Ottoman garrisons in the Peloponnese then surrendered while the Greeks proceeded to the Ottoman-controlled part of central Greece. As a result of years of negotiation Greece was finally recognized as an independent nation in the Treaty of Constantinople of May 1832. The Revolution is celebrated by the modern Greek state as a national day on 25 March. ,1

A strike usually takes place in response to employee grievances. Strikes became common during the Industrial Revolution when mass labor became important in factories and mines. In most countries strike actions were quickly made illegal as factory owners had far more power than workers. Most Western countries partially legalized striking in the late 19th or early 20th centuries. Strikes are sometimes used to pressure governments to change policies. Occasionally strikes destabilize the rule of a particular political party or ruler; in such cases strikes are often part of a broader social movement taking the form of a campaign of civil resistance. Notable examples are the 1980 Gdańsk Shipyard or 1981 Warning Strike led by Lech Wałęsa. These strikes were significant in the long campaign of civil resistance for political change in Poland and were an important mobilizing effort that contributed to the fall of the Iron Curtain and the end of communist party rule in eastern Europe. ,1

359,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanian_Revolution,The Romanian Revolution Romanian: Revoluția Română was a period of violent civil unrest in Romania in December 1989 and part of the Revolutions of 1989 that occurred in several countries. The Romanian Revolution started in the city of Timișoara and soon spread throughout the country ultimately culminating in the show trial and execution of longtime Communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu and the end of 42 years of Communist rule in Romania. It was also the last removal of a Communist government in a Warsaw Pact country during the events of 1989 and the only one that violently overthrew a countrys government and executed its leader. Early protests occurred in the city of Timișoara in mid-December on the part of the Hungarian minority in response to an attempt by the government to evict Hungarian Reformed church pastor László Tőkés. In response Romanians sought revolution and a change in government in light of similar recent events in neighboring nations. The countrys ubiquitous secret police force the Securitate which was both one of the largest in the Eastern Bloc and for decades had been the main suppressor of popular dissension frequently and violently quashing political disagreement ultimately proved powerless in stopping the looming and then highly fatal and successful revolt. Social and economic malaise had been present in socialist Romania for quite some time especially during the austerity years of the 1980s. The austerity measures were designed in part by Ceaușescu to repay foreign debts. Shortly after a botched public speech by Ceaușescu in Bucharest Romanias capital city that was broadcast to millions of Romanians on state television rank-and-file members of the military switched almost unanimously from supporting the dictator to backing the protesting population. Riots street violence and murder in several Romanian cities over the course of roughly a week led the Romanian strongman to flee the capital city on 22 December with his wife Deputy Prime Minister Elena Ceaușescu. Evading capture by hastily departing via helicopter effectively portrayed the couple as both fugitives and also acutely guilty of accused crimes. Captured in Târgoviște they were tried by a drumhead military tribunal on charges of genocide damage to the national economy and abuse of power to execute military actions against the Romanian people. They were convicted on all charges sentenced to death and immediately executed on Christmas Day 1989 becoming the last persons condemned to death and executed in Romania. Present-day Romania has unfolded in the shadow of the Ceaușescus along with its communist past and the tumultuous departure from it. The National Salvation Front quickly took power after Ceaușescu was toppled promising free and fair elections within five months. Elected in a landslide the following May the National Salvation Front reconstituted as a political party installed a series of economic and democratic reforms with further social policy changes being implemented by later governments. Since that point Romania has become far more integrated with the West than its former albeit tepid relations with Moscow. Romania became a member of NATO and the European Union in 2004 and 2007 respectively. Democratic reforms have proven to be moderately successful. Economic reforms continue with Romania still possessing for example one of the largest child poverty rates in the developed world. ,1

The coup should be seen in the context of the greater Dutch Revolt that was breaking out in this time. Trade interests played an important role because Amsterdam was becoming isolated as surrounding cities and towns joined the revolt and other cities were threatening to take over its trade. No one was injured or killed during the coup. On May 29 a new city council was formed consisting of 30 Calvinists and 10 Catholics.

It is distinguished from the traditional private press by its emphasis on quick cheap production. Presses associated with the Mimeo Revolution often published experimental and underground work and were important venues for poets writers and artists ignored by mainstream magazines. Their emphasis was often but not always on poetry including work by the Black Mountain poets the poets of the Beat Generation the New York School and the San Francisco Renaissance as well as such experimental genres as Concrete Poetry.

365,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social_data_revolution,The social data revolution is the shift in human communication patterns towards increased personal information sharing and its related implications made possible by the rise of social networks in early 2000s. This phenomenon has resulted in the accumulation of unprecedented amounts of public data. This large and frequently updated data source has been described as a new type of scientific instrument for the social sciences. Several independent researchers have used social data to nowcast and forecast trends such as unemployment flu outbreaks mood of whole populations travel spending and political opinions in a way that is faster more accurate and cheaper than standard government reports or Gallup polls. Social data refers to data individuals create that is knowingly and voluntarily shared by them. Cost and overhead previously rendered this semi-public form of communication unfeasible but advances in social networking technology from 2004-2010 has made broader concepts of sharing possible. The types of data users are sharing include geolocation medical data dating preferences open thoughts interesting news articles etc. Early examples of social data are Craigslist and the wishlists of Amazon.com. Both enable users to communicate information to anybody who is looking for it. They differ in their approach to identity. Craigslist leverages the power of anonymity while Amazon.com leverages the power of persistent identity based on the history of the customer with the firm. The job market is even being shaped by the information people share about themselves on sites like LinkedIn and Facebook. Examples of more mature social data are Twitter and Facebook. On Twitter sending a message or tweet is as simple as sending an SMS text message. Twitter made this C2W customer to world: Any tweet a user sends can potentially be read by the entire world. Facebook focuses on interactions between friends C2C in traditional language. It provides many ways for collecting data from its users: tag a friend in a photo comment on what they posted or just like it. These data are the basis for sophisticated models of the relationships between users. They can be used to significantly increase the relevance of what is shown to the user and for advertising purposes. The social data revolution does not only enable new business models like the ones on Amazon.com but also provides large opportunities to improve decision-making for public policy and international development. The analysis of large amounts of social data leads to the field of computational social science. Classic examples include the study of media content or of social media content. ,1

In 1894 the magistrate of Gobu Jo Byeonggap had created various bogus laws and forced the peasants to build reservoirs and settle in unowned lands in order to get rich from taxes and fines. In March angered peasants allied under Jeon Bongjun and Kim Gaenam beginning the Gobu Revolt. However the Gobu revolt was suppressed by Yi Yongtae and Jeon Bongjun fled to Taein. In April Jeon gathered an army in Mount Baek and recaptured Gobu. The rebels then proceeded to defeat governmental forces in Hwangto Pass and the Hwangryong River. Jeon then captured Jeonju Fortress and fought in a siege with Hong Gyehuns Joseon forces. In May however the rebels had signed a truce with the governmental forces and built agencies called Jibgangso that handled affairs in rebel-controlled areas. This somewhat unsteady peace continued throughout the summer. The frightened government asked the Qing Dynasty for help and it sent 2700 soldiers to Korea. Japan angered that the Qing government had not informed Japan as promised in the Convention of Tientsin started the Sino-Japanese War. The war resulted in an expulsion of Chinese influence in Korea and also signaled an end for the Self-Strengthening Movement in China itself. Growing Japanese dominance in the Korean peninsula had caused anxiety for the rebels. From September to October the Southern and Northern leaders negotiated over the plans for the future in Samrye. In October 12 a coalition army of Northern and Southern Jeobs were formed and the army numbering 25000~200000 records differ went on to attack Gongju. After a number of battles the rebel army was decisively defeated in the Battle of Ugeumchi and the rebels were again defeated in the Battle of Taein. Hostility continued deep into the spring of 1895.

367,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tobacco_Protest,The Tobacco Protest was a Shia revolt in Iran against an 1890 tobacco concession granted by the Shah to Great Britain. The protest was held by Tehran merchants in solidarity with the clerics. It climaxed in a widely-obeyed December 1891 edict misunderstood as a fatwa against tobacco use supposedly issued by Grand Ayatollah Mirza Hassan Shirazi. Beginning in the 19th century the Qajar dynasty found itself in a precarious situation due to an increasing foreign presence within Iran. Reeling from devastating losses against the Russian Empire in 1813 and 1828 as well as the British Empire in 1857 not only was the Qajar government forced to grant countless concessions to these foreign powers but Iranian bazaaris merchants were left in a highly vulnerable position as they couldn’t compete with the numerous economic advantages gained by merchants from Europe. According to the accounts of foreigners living in Iran at the time the Qajar dynasty was highly unpopular among the populace and was perceived as having little concern for the welfare of its residents. Later accounts by British eyewitnesses suggest that the reason why the dynasty had not been overthrown sooner in the face of widespread discontent was due to British and Russian intervention that essentially propped up the shah. In 1872 Nasir al-Din Shah negotiated a concession with Baron Julius de Reuter a British citizen granting him control over Persian roads telegraphs mills factories extraction of resources and other public works in exchange for a stipulated sum for 5 years and 60% of all the net revenue for 20 years. The Reuter concession was met with not only domestic outrage in the form of local protests but the Russian government was also hostile towards the concession as well. Under immense pressure Nasir al-Din Shah consequently canceled the agreement despite his deteriorating financial situation. While the concession lasted for approximately a year the entire debacle set the foundation for the revolts against the tobacco concession in 1890 as it demonstrated that any attempt by a foreign power to infringe upon Iranian sovereignty would infuriate the local population as well as rival European powers in this case the Russian government who had their own interests in the region. ,1

The election was the fourth presidential election to take place in Ukraine following independence from the Soviet Union. The last stages of the election were contested between the opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko and the incumbent Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych from the Party of Regions. The election was held in a highly charged political atmosphere with allegations of media bias voter intimidation and a poisoning of candidate Yushchenko with dioxin. According to Ukraine\s electoral law a two-round system is used to elect the President in which a candidate must win a majority 50% or more of all ballots cast. The first round of voting was held on October 31 2004. As no candidate had 50% or more of the votes cast a run-off ballot between the two-highest polling candidates Viktor Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych was held on November 21. According to official Central Election Commission results announced on November 23 the run-off election was won by Viktor Yanukovych. The election results were challenged by Viktor Yushchenko and his supporters with many international observers claiming that the election was rigged. The subsequent events led to a political crisis in Ukraine with widespread peaceful protesters dubbed the Orange Revolution calling for a re-run second round election. The Ukrainian Supreme Court annulled the official run-off results and ordered a repeat of second round ballot. The final re-run ballot was held on December 26. Viktor Yushchenko was declared the winner with 52 percent of the vote to Yanukovych\s 44 percent.

The popular movement was remarkable for its avoidance of violence peaceful approach and its total reliance on methods of civil resistance. The primary goals of the activists were the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the replacement of a government heavily influenced by Syrian interests with more independent leadership the establishment of an international commission to investigate the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri the resignation of security officials to ensure the success of the plan and the organization of free parliamentary elections. The demonstrators demanded the end of the Syrian influence in Lebanese politics. At the start of the demonstrations Syria had been maintaining a force of roughly 14000 soldiers and intelligence agents in Lebanon. Following the demonstrations the Syrian troops completely withdrew from Lebanon on 27 April 2005. With the disbanding of the Pro-Syrian government the main goals of the revolution were achieved.

It was succeeded in the mid-18th century by the Industrial Revolution. Beginning with the Crusades Europeans rediscovered spices silks and other commodities rare in Europe. This development created a new desire for trade and trade expanded in the second half of the Middle Ages. Newly forming European states through voyages of discovery were looking for alternative trade routes in the 15th and 16th centuries which allowed the European powers to build vast new international trade networks. Nations also sought and found new sources of wealth. The Commercial Revolution is marked by an increase in general commerce and in the growth of financial services such as banking insurance and investing. ,1
371,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mexican_Revolution,The Mexican Revolution Spanish: Revolución mexicana was a major armed struggle ca. 1910–20 that radically transformed Mexican culture and government. Although recent research has focused on local and regional aspects of the Revolution it was a genuinely national revolution. Its outbreak in 1910 resulted from the failure of the 35-year long regime of Porfirio Díaz to find a managed solution to the presidential succession. This meant there was a political crisis among competing elites and the opportunity for agrarian insurrection. Wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero challenged Díaz in 1910 presidential election and following the rigged results revolted under the Plan of San Luis Potosí. Armed conflict ousted Díaz from power and a new election was held in 1911 bringing Madero to the presidency. The origins of the conflict were broadly based in opposition to the Díaz regime with the 1910 election becoming the sparking point for the outbreak of a political rebellion. Elements of the Mexican elite hostile to Díaz led by Madero expanded to the middle class the peasantry in some regions and organized labor. In October 1911 Madero was overwhelmingly elected in a free and fair election. Opposition to the Madero regime increased from both the conservatives who saw him as too weak and too liberal and from former revolutionary fighters and the dispossessed who saw him as too conservative. In February 1913 Madero and his vice president Pino Suárez were forced to resign were assassinated and the counter-revolutionary regime of General Victoriano Huerta came to power backed by the U.S. business interests and other supporters of the old order. Huerta remained in power from February 1913 until July 1914 when he was forced out by a coalition of different regional revolutionary forces. Then the revolutionaries\ attempt to come to a political agreement following Huerta\s ouster failed and Mexico was plunged into a civil war 1914–15. The Constitutionalist faction under wealthy landowner Venustiano Carranza emerged as the victor in 1915 defeating the revolutionary forces of former Constitutionalist Pancho Villa and forcing revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata back to guerrilla warfare. Zapata was assassinated in 1919 by agents of President Carranza. The armed conflict lasted for the better part of a decade until around 1920 and had several distinct phases. Over time the Revolution changed from a revolt against the established order under Díaz to a multi-sided civil war in particular regions with frequently shifting power struggles among factions in the Mexican Revolution. One major result of the revolution was the disappearance of the Federal Army in 1914 which Francisco Madero had kept intact when he was elected in 1911 and General Victoriano Huerta used to oust Madero. Revolutionary forces unified against Huerta\s reactionary regime defeated the Federal forces. Although the conflict was primarily a civil war foreign powers that had important economic and strategic interests in Mexico figured in the outcome of Mexico\s power struggles. The United States played an especially significant role. Out of Mexico\s population of 15 million the losses were high but numerical estimates vary a great deal. Perhaps 1.5 million people died; nearly 200000 refugees fled abroad especially to the United States. Politically the promulgation of the Mexican Constitution of 1917 is seen by many scholars as the end point of the armed conflict. “Economic and social conditions improved in accordance with revolutionary policies so that the new society took shape within a framework of official revolutionary institutions” with the constitution providing that framework. The period 1920–1940 is often considered to be a phase of the Revolution during which power was consolidated and the revolutionary constitution of 1917 was implemented. This armed conflict is often categorized as the most important sociopolitical event in Mexico and one of the greatest upheavals of the 20th century; it resulted in an important program of experimentation and reform in social organization. ,1

They were a series of loosely coordinated protests and rebellions in the states of the German Confederation including the Austrian Empire. The revolutions which stressed pan-Germanism demonstrated popular discontent with the traditional largely autocratic political structure of the thirty-nine independent states of the Confederation that inherited the German territory of the former Holy Roman Empire. They demonstrated the popular desire for the Zollverein movement. The middle-class elements were committed to liberal principles while the working class sought radical improvements to their working and living conditions. As the middle class and working class components of the Revolution split the conservative aristocracy defeated it. Liberals were forced into exile to escape political persecution where they became known as Forty-Eighters. Many immigrated to the United States settling from Wisconsin to Texas. ,1

As Italian nationalists they sought to eliminate reactionary Austrian control. During this time period Italy was not a unified country and was divided into many states which in Northern Italy were ruled by the Austrian Empire. A desire to be free from foreign rule and the conservative leadership of the Austrians led the Italian people to stage revolution in order to drive out the Austrians. The revolution was led by the state of Piedmont one of the four states where the Austrian leaders were forced to grant liberal rights. Also the uprisings in the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia particularly in Milan forced the Austrian General Radetzky to retreat to the Quadrilatero Quadrilateral fortresses. King Charles Albert who ruled Piedmont-Sardinia from 1831 to 1849 aspired to unite Italy under his leadership. He declared war on Austria and launched a full-out attack on the Quadrilateral. Lacking allies Charles Albert was no match for the Austrian army. He was defeated at the Battle of Custoza July 24 1848 signed a truce and withdrew his forces from Lombardy.

380,http://dbpedia.org/resource/May_1968_events_in_France,The volatile period of civil unrest in France during May 1968 was punctuated by demonstrations and massive general strikes as well as the occupation of universities and factories across France. At the height of its fervor it brought the entire economy of France to a virtual halt. The protests reached such a point that political leaders feared civil war or revolution; the national government itself momentarily ceased to function after President Charles de Gaulle secretly left France for a few hours. The protests spurred an artistic movement with songs imaginative graffiti posters and slogans but also intense violence which ultimately ensured their defeat and the Gaullist government to remain strong and unopposed by its socialist critics. May 68 had a resounding impact on French society that would be felt for decades to come. It is considered to this day as a cultural social and moral turning point in the history of the country. As Alain Geismar—one of the leaders of the time—later pointed out the movement succeeded as a social revolution not as a political one. The unrest began with a series of student occupation protests against capitalism consumerism and traditional institutions values and order. It then spread to factories with strikes involving 11 million workers more than 22% of the total population of France at the time for two continuous weeks. The movement was characterized by its spontaneous and de-centralized wildcat disposition; this created contrast and sometimes even conflict between itself and the establishment trade unions and workers\ parties. It was the largest general strike ever attempted in France and the first ever nationwide wildcat general strike. The student occupations and wildcat general strikes initiated across France were met with forceful confrontation by university administrators and police. The de Gaulle administration\s attempts to quell those strikes by police action only inflamed the situation further leading to street battles with the police in the Latin Quarter followed by the spread of general strikes and occupations throughout France. De Gaulle went to a French military base in Germany and after returning dissolved the National Assembly and called for new parliamentary elections for 23 June 1968. Violence evaporated almost as quickly as it arose. Workers went back to their jobs and when the elections were finally held in June the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before. ,1

The revolution was named Xinhai Hsin-hai because it occurred in 1911 the year of the Xinhai 辛亥 stem-branch in the sexagenary cycle of the Chinese calendar. The revolution consisted of many revolts and uprisings. The turning point was the Wuchang Uprising on October 10 1911 that was a result of the mishandling of the Railway Protection Movement. The revolution ended with the abdication of the six-year-old Last Emperor Puyi on February 12 1912 that marked the end of 2000 years of imperial rule and the beginning of China\s early republican era 1912–16. The revolution arose mainly in response to the decline of the Qing state which had proven ineffective in its efforts to modernize China and confront foreign aggression and was exacerbated by ethnic resentment against the ruling Manchu minority. Many underground anti-Qing groups with the support of Chinese revolutionaries in exile tried to overthrow the Qing. The brief civil war that ensued was ended through a political compromise between Yuan Shikai the late Qing military strongman and Sun Yat-sen the leader of the Tongmenghui United League. After the Qing court transferred power to the newly founded republic a provisional coalition government was created along with the National Assembly. However political power of the new national government in Beijing was soon thereafter monopolized by Yuan and led to decades of political division and warlordism including several attempts at imperial restoration. The Republic of China in Taiwan and the People\s Republic of China on the mainland consider themselves the legitimate successors to the Xinhai Revolution and revere the ideals of the revolution including nationalism republicanism modernization of China and national unity. October 10 is commemorated in Taiwan as Double Ten Day the National Day of the ROC. In mainland China Hong Kong and Macau the same day is usually celebrated as the Anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution. Many overseas Chinese also celebrate the anniversary in Chinatowns across the world. ,1

The war was preceded by protests in Zawiya on 8 August 2009 and finally ignited by protests in Benghazi beginning on Tuesday 15 February 2011 which led to clashes with security forces that fired on the crowd. The protests escalated into a rebellion that spread across the country with the forces opposing Gaddafi establishing an interim governing body the National Transitional Council. The United Nations Security Council passed an initial resolution on 26 February freezing the assets of Gaddafi and his inner circle and restricting their travel and referred the matter to the International Criminal Court for investigation. In early March Gaddafi\s forces rallied pushed eastwards and re-took several coastal cities before reaching Benghazi. A further UN resolution authorised member states to establish and enforce a no-fly zone over Libya and to use all necessary measures to prevent attacks on civilians. The Gaddafi government then announced a ceasefire but fighting continued. Throughout the conflict rebels rejected government offers of a ceasefire and efforts by the African Union to end the fighting because the plans set forth did not include the removal of Gaddafi. In August rebel forces launched an offensive on the government-held coast of Libya taking back territory lost months before and ultimately capturing the capital city of Tripoli while Gaddafi evaded capture and loyalists engaged in a rearguard campaign. On 16 September 2011 the National Transitional Council was recognised by the United Nations as the legal representative of Libya replacing the Gaddafi government. Muammar Gaddafi remained at large until 20 October 2011 when he was captured and killed attempting to escape from Sirte. The National Transitional Council declared the liberation of Libya and the official end of the war on 23 October 2011. In the aftermath of the civil war a low-level insurgency by former Gaddafi loyalists continued. There have been various disagreements and strife between local militia and tribes including fighting on 23 January 2012 in the former Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid leading to an alternative town council being established and later recognized by the NTC. A much greater issue has been the role of militias which fought in the civil war and their role in the new Libya. Some have refused to disarm and cooperation with the NTC has been strained leading to demonstrations against militias and government action to disband such groups or integrate them into the Libyan military. These unresolved issues led directly to a second civil war in Libya. ,1

386,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serbian_Revolution,The Serbian Revolution refers to the national uprising and constitutional change in Serbia taking place between 1804 and 1835 during which this territory evolved from an Ottoman province into a rebel territory a constitutional monarchy and a modern Serbia. The first part of the period from 1804 to 1815 was marked by a violent struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire with two armed uprisings taking place ending with a ceasefire. The later period 1815–1835 witnessed a peaceful consolidation of political power of the increasingly autonomous Serbia culminating in the recognition of the right to hereditary rule by Serbian princes in 1830 and 1833 and the territorial expansion of the young monarchy. The adoption of the first written Constitution in 1835 abolished feudalism and serfdom and made the country suzerain. The term Serbian Revolution was coined by a German academic historiographer Leopold von Ranke in his book Die Serbische Revolution published in 1829. These events marked the foundation of modern Serbia. The period is further divided as follows: \n* First Serbian Uprising 1804–13 led by Karađorđe Petrović \n* Hadži Prodans revolt 1814 \n* Second Serbian Uprising 1815 under Miloš Obrenović \n*  Official recognition of the Serbian state 1815–1833 The Proclamation 1809 by Karađorđe in the capital Belgrade probably represented the apex of the first phase. It called for national unity drawing on Serbian history to demand the freedom of religion and formal written rule of law both of which the Ottoman Empire had failed to provide. It also called on Serbs to stop paying taxes to the Porte deemed unfair as based on religious affiliation. Apart from dispensing with poll tax on non-Muslims jizya the revolutionaries also abolished all feudal obligations in 1806 only 15 years after the French revolution peasant and serf emancipation thus representing a major social break with the past. The rule of Miloš Obrenović consolidated the achievements of the Uprisings leading to the proclamation of the first constitution in the Balkans and the establishment of the oldest Balkan institution of higher learning still in existence the Great Academy of Belgrade 1808. In 1830 and again in 1833 Serbia was recognized as an autonomous principality with hereditary princes paying annual tribute to the Porte. Finally de facto independence came in 1868 with the withdrawal of Ottoman garrisons from the principality; de jure independence was formally recognized at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. ,1
387,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military_Revolution,The Military Revolution was a radical change in military strategy and tactics with resulting major changes in government. The concept was introduced by Michael Roberts in the 1950s as he focused on Sweden 1560–1660 searching for major changes in the European way of war caused by introduction of portable firearms. Roberts linked military technology with larger historical consequences arguing that innovations in tactics drill and doctrine by the Dutch and Swedes 1560–1660 which maximized the utility of firearms led to a need for more trained troops and thus for permanent forces standing armies. These changes in turn had major political consequences in the level of administrative support and the supply of money men and provisions producing new financial demands and the creation of new governmental institutions. Thus argued Roberts the modern art of war made possible—and necessary—the creation of the modern state. In the 1990s the concept was modified and extended by Geoffrey Parker who argued that developments in fortification and siege warfare caused the revolution. The concept of a military revolution in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries has received a mixed reception among historians. Noted military historians Christopher Duffy and Jeremy Black have strongly criticised it as misleading exaggerated and simplistic. ,1
388,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urban_revolution,In anthropology and archaeology the Urban Revolution is the process by which small kin-based nonliterate agricultural villages were transformed into large socially complex urban societies. The term urban revolution was introduced in the 1930s by V. Gordon Childe an Australian archaeologist. Childe also coined the term Neolithic Revolution to describe the earlier process by which Hunter-Gatherer Societies domesticated crops and animals and began a farming lifestyle. Childe was the first to synthesize and organize the large volume of new archaeological data in the early 20th century in social terms. Whereas previous archaeologists had concentrated on chronology and technology Childe applied concepts and theories from the social sciences to interpret archaeological finds.Childe first discussed the Urban Revolution in his 1936 book Man Makes Himself and then his 1950 article in the journal Town Planning Review brought the concept to a much larger audience. In that paper he presented a 10-point model for the changes that characterized the Urban Revolution: 1.  \n*  Large population and large settlements cities 2.  \n*  Full-time specialization and advanced division of labor 3.  \n*  Production of an agricultural surplus to fund government and a differentiated society 4.  \n*  Monumental public architecture 5.  \n*  A ruling class 6.  \n*  Writing 7.  \n*  Exact and predictive sciences arithmetic geometry astronomy calendars 8.  \n*  Sophisticated art styles 9.  \n*  Long-distance trade 10.  \n*  The state Although sometimes interpreted as a model of the origins of cities and urbanism Childe\s concept in fact describes the transition from agricultural villages to state-level urban societies. This change which occurred independently in several parts of the world is recognized as one of the most significant changes in human Sociocultural evolution.Although contemporary models for the origins of complex urban societies have progressed beyond Childe\s original formulation there is general agreement that he correctly identified one of the most far-reaching social transformations prior to the Industrial Revolution as well as the major processes involved in the change. ,1

Key events occurred on 8 August 1988 and therefore it is known as the 8888 Uprising. The protests began as a student movement and was organized largely by university students at the Rangoon Arts and Sciences University and the Rangoon Institute of Technology RIT. Since 1962 the country had been ruled by the Burma Socialist Programme Party regime as a one-party state headed by General Ne Win. The catastrophic Burmese Way to Socialism had turned Burma into one of the worlds most impoverished countries. Many firms in the formal sector of the economy were nationalised and the government combined Soviet-style central planning although the process was rather ineffective with Buddhist and superstitious beliefs. The 8888 uprising was started by students in Yangon Rangoon on 8 August 1988. Student protests spread throughout the country. Hundreds of thousands of ochre-robed monks children university students housewives doctors and people from all walks of life demonstrated against the regime. The uprising ended on 18 September after a bloody military coup by the State Law and Order Restoration Council SLORC. Thousands of deaths have been attributed to the military during this uprising while authorities in Myanmar put the figure at around 350 people killed. During the crisis Aung San Suu Kyi emerged as a national icon. When the military junta arranged an election in 1990 her party the National League for Democracy won 80% of the seats in the government 392 out of 492. But the military junta suppressed everything that could have developed from these democratic achievements. Part of the strategy was to place Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest. The State Law and Order Restoration Council would be a cosmetic change from the Burma Socialist Programme Party. Suu Kyis house arrest would be lifted no earlier than in 2010 when worldwide attention for her peaked again during the making of the biographical film The Lady. ,1

397,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1991_uprisings_in_Iraq,The 1991 uprisings in Iraq were a series of popular rebellions in northern and southern Iraq in March and April 1991 in a cease fire of the Gulf War. The mostly uncoordinated insurgency often referred to as the Shaaban Intifada among Arabs and as the National Uprising among Kurds was fueled by the perception that then Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was responsible for systemic social repression and had become vulnerable to regime change. This perception of weakness was largely the result of the outcome of two prior wars: the Iran–Iraq War and the invasion of Kuwait both of which occurred within a single decade and devastated the economy and population of Iraq. Within the first two weeks most of Iraqs cities and provinces fell to rebel forces. Participants of the uprising were a diverse mix of ethnic religious and political affiliations including military mutineers Shia Arab Islamists Kurdish nationalists and far-left groups. Following initial victories the revolution was held back from continued success by internal divisions as well as a lack of anticipated American support. Saddams Sunni Arab-dominated Baath Party regime managed to maintain control over the capital of Baghdad and soon largely suppressed the rebels in a brutal campaign conducted by loyalist forces spearheaded by the Iraqi Republican Guard. During the brief roughly one-month period of unrest tens of thousands of people died and nearly two million people were displaced. After the conflict the Iraqi government intensified a prior systematic forced relocation of Marsh Arabs and the draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes in the Tigris–Euphrates river system. The Persian Gulf War Coalition established Iraqi no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq and the Kurdish opposition established the Kurdish Autonomous Republic in what is now commonly referred to as Iraqi Kurdistan. ,1

401,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brabant_Revolution,The Brabant Revolution or Brabantine Revolution French: Révolution brabançonne Dutch: Brabantse Omwenteling sometimes referred to as the Belgian Revolution of 1789–90 in older writing was an armed insurrection that occurred in the Austrian Netherlands modern-day Belgium between October 1789 and December 1790. The revolution which occurred at the same time as revolutions in France and Liège led to the brief overthrow of Habsburg rule and the proclamation of a short-lived polity the United Belgian States through the unification of the regions federated states. The revolution was the product of opposition which emerged to the liberal reforms of Emperor Joseph II in the 1780s. These were perceived as an attack on the Catholic Church and the traditional institutions in the Austrian Netherlands. Resistance focused in the autonomous and wealthy Estates of Brabant and Flanders grew. In the aftermath of rioting and disruption known as the Small Revolution in 1787 many dissidents took refuge in the neighboring Dutch Republic where they formed a rebel army. Soon after the outbreak of the French and Liège revolutions the émigré army crossed into the Austrian Netherlands and decisively defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Turnhout in October 1789. The rebels supported by uprisings across the territory soon took control over virtually all the Southern Netherlands and proclaimed independence. Despite the tacit support of Prussia the independent United Belgian States established in January 1790 received no foreign recognition and the rebels soon became divided along ideological lines. The Vonckists led by Jan Frans Vonck advocated progressive and liberal government whereas the Statists led by Hendrik Van der Noot were staunchly conservative and supported by the Church. The Statists who had a wider base of support soon drove the Vonckists into exile through a terror. By mid-1790 Habsburg Austria ended its war with the Ottoman Empire and prepared to suppress the Brabant revolutionaries. The new Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II was a liberal like his predecessor but proposed an amnesty for the rebels. After defeating a Statist army at the Battle of Falmagne the territory was quickly overrun by Holy Roman forces and the revolution was defeated by December. The Austrian reestablishment was short-lived however and the territory was soon overrun by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars. Because of its distinctive course the Brabant Revolution had been extensively used in historical comparisons with the French Revolution. Some historians following Henri Pirenne have seen it as a key moment in the formation of a Belgian nation-state and an influence on the Belgian Revolution of 1830. ,1

Two days later the legislature formally deleted the sections of the Constitution giving the Communists a monopoly of power. Barbed wire and other obstructions were removed from the border with West Germany and Austria in early December. On December 10 President Gustáv Husák appointed the first largely non-communist government in Czechoslovakia since 1948 and resigned. Alexander Dubček was elected speaker of the federal parliament on December 28 and Václav Havel the President of Czechoslovakia on December 29 1989. In June 1990 Czechoslovakia held its first democratic elections since 1946. The term Velvet Revolution was coined by Rita Klímová the dissidents English translator who later became the ambassador to the United States. The term was used internationally to describe the revolution although the Czechs also used the term internally. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993 Slovakia used the term Gentle Revolution the term that Slovaks used for the revolution from the beginning. The Czech Republic continues to refer to the event as the Velvet Revolution. ,1

The coup’s significance extended well beyond the country’s boundaries as it was a clear marker along the already well-advanced road to full-fledged Cold War. The event alarmed Western countries and helped spur quick adoption of the Marshall Plan the creation of a state in West Germany vigorous measures to keep Communists out of power in France and especially Italy and steps toward mutual security that would in little over a year result in the establishment of NATO and the definitive drawing of the Iron Curtain until the fall of Communism in 1989. ,1
419,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgian_Revolution,The Belgian Revolution was the conflict which led to the secession of the southern provinces mainly the former Southern Netherlands from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and established an independent Kingdom of Belgium. The people of the south were nearly all Catholics; half were French-speaking. Many outspoken liberals regarded King William I\s rule as despotic. There were high levels of unemployment and industrial unrest among the working classes. On 25 August 1830 riots erupted in Brussels and shops were looted. Theatergoers who had just watched a nationalistic opera joined the mob. Uprisings followed elsewhere in the country. Factories were occupied and machinery destroyed. Order was restored briefly after William committed troops to the Southern Provinces but rioting continued and leadership was taken up by radicals who started talking of secession. Dutch units saw the mass desertion of recruits from the southern provinces and pulled out. The States-General in Brussels voted in favour of secession and declared independence. In the aftermath a National Congress was assembled. King William refrained from future military action and appealed to the Great Powers. The resulting 1830 London Conference of major European powers recognized Belgian independence. Following the installation of Leopold I as King of the Belgians in 1831 King William made a belated military attempt to reconquer Belgium and restore his position through a military campaign. This Ten Days\ Campaign failed because of French military intervention. Not until 1839 did the Dutch accept the decision of the London conference and Belgian independence by signing the Treaty of London. ,1

Known as the Coup of 1930 the revolution ousted President Washington Luís on October 24 1930 prevented the inauguration of President-elect Júlio Prestes and ended the Old Republic. In 1929 leaders of São Paulo broke the alliance with the mineiros i.e. people from Minas Gerais state known as the coffee with milk policy política do café-com-leite in Portuguese and indicated the paulista Júlio Prestes as a candidate for the presidency. In response the President of Minas Gerais Antônio Carlos Ribeiro de Andrada supported the opposition candidate from the south Getúlio Vargas. On March 1 1930 elections for President were held and victory was won by the government\s candidate Júlio Prestes who was the president of São Paulo state. However he did not take office because the coup was triggered on October 3 1930; he was instead exiled. Getúlio Vargas assumed the leadership of the provisional government on November 3 1930 a date that marks the end of the Old Republic. ,1
421,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constitutionalist_Revolution,The Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932 sometimes also referred to as Paulista War or Brazilian Civil War is the name given to the uprising of the population of the Brazilian state of São Paulo against the 1930 coup détat when Getúlio Vargas forcibly assumed the nations Presidency; Vargas was supported by the military and the political elites of Minas Gerais Rio Grande do Sul and Paraíba. The movement grew out of local resentment from the fact that Vargas ruled by decree unbound by a Constitution in a provisional government. The 1930 coup also affected São Paulo by eroding the autonomy that states enjoyed during the term of the 1891 Constitution and preventing the inauguration of the governor of São Paulo Júlio Prestes in the Presidency of the Republic while simultaneously overthrowing President Washington Luís who was governor of São Paulo from 1920 to 1924. These events marked the end of the First Republic. Vargas appointed a northeasterner as governor of São Paulo. The Revolutions main goal was to press the provisional government headed by Getúlio Vargas to abide by a new Constitution since the elected President Prestes was kept from taking office. However as the movement developed and resentment against President Vargas and his revolutionary government grew deeper it came to advocate the overthrow of the Federal Government and it was even speculated that one of the Revolutionaries goals was the secession of São Paulo from the Brazilian federation. However it is noted that the separatist scenario was used as guerrilla tactics by the Federal Government to turn the population of the rest of the country against the state of São Paulo broadcasting the alleged separatist notion throughout the country. There is no evidence that the movements commanders sought separatism. The uprising commenced on 9 July 1932 after four protesting students were killed by government troops on 23 May 1932. On the wake of their deaths a movement called MMDC from the initials of the names of each of the four students killed Martins Miragaia Dráusio and Camargo started. A fifth victim Alvarenga was also shot that night but died months later. In a few months the state of São Paulo rebelled against the federal government. Counting on the solidarity of the political elites of two other powerful states Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul the politicians from São Paulo expected a quick war. However that solidarity was never translated into actual support and the São Paulo revolt was militarily crushed on October 2 1932. In total there were 87 days of fighting July 9 to October 4 1932—with the last two days after the surrender of São Paulo with a balance of 934 official deaths though non-official estimates report up to 2200 dead and many cities in the state of São Paulo suffered damage due to fighting. In spite of its military defeat some of the movements main demands were finally granted by Vargas afterwards: the appointment of a non-military state Governor the election of a Constituent Assembly and finally the enactment of a new Constitution in 1934. However that Constitution was short-lived as in 1937 amidst growing extremism on the left and right wings of the political spectrum Vargas closed the National Congress and enacted another Constitution which established an authoritarian regime called Estado Novo. July 9 marks the beginning of the Revolution of 1932 and is a holiday and the most important civic date of the state of São Paulo. The paulistas as the inhabitants of São Paulo are known consider the Revolution of 1932 as the greatest movement of its civic history. It was the first major revolt against the government of Getúlio Vargas and the last major armed conflict occurring in the history of Brazil. ,1

Inspired by the monarchist ideologies from Gaspar da Silveira Martins it had Gumercindo Saraiva as the military head. The revolutionaries known as Maragatos faced the defeated in the Battle of the Pulador in 1894 by the troops of Pinheiro Machado but the peace was only concluded definitively on the following year. ,1
423,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peaceful_Revolution,The Peaceful Revolution German: Friedliche Revolution was the process of sociopolitical change that led to the end of the SED dominance of the German Democratic Republic GDR or East Germany and the transition to a parliamentary democracy which enabled the reunification of Germany. This turning point was wholly created through the violence-free initiatives protests and successful demonstrations which decisively occurred between the local elections held in May 1989 and the GDRs first free parliamentary election in March 1990. These events were closely linked to the Soviet Union’s decision under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev to abandon its hegemony in Eastern Europe as well as the reformist movements that spread through the region as a result. In addition to the Soviet Union’s shift in foreign policy – part of its glasnost and perestroika reforms hastened the destabilization of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany] and the success of the counter revolution. Those driving the reform process within the GDR included intellectuals and church figures the significant amount of people attempting to flee the country – thus displaying a clear sign of the discontentment with the democratic SED government – as well as the rising number of peaceful demonstrators who were no longer willing to yield to the threat of violence and repression by the authorities. On account of its hostile response to the reforms implemented within its “socialist brother lands” the SED leadership was already increasingly isolated within the Eastern Bloc by the time it finally decided to abstain from the use of force to suppress the ever-larger public demonstrations and permitted the opening of the border at the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989. Through a change in leadership and a willingness to talk with opponents the SED initially attempted to win back the political initiative. However due to the continued political instability and the threat of national bankruptcy control of the situation increasingly lay with the West German government under Chancellor Helmut Kohl. From the start of December 1989 the GDR government of Prime Minister Hans Modrow was controlled from a Central Round Table at which the dissolution of the suppressive state security service the Stasi was put into action and preparations were made for free elections. After a sweeping election win for the “Alliance for Germany” coalition the political path within the GDR was now clear for a swift reunification of the two German states. ,1
424,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unification_of_Germany,The unification of Germany into a politically and administratively integrated nation state officially occurred on 18 January 1871 in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles in France. Princes of the German states gathered there to proclaim Wilhelm I of Prussia as German Emperor after the French capitulation in the Franco-Prussian War. Unofficially the de facto transition of most of the German-speaking populations into a federated organization of states had been developing for some time through alliances formal and informal between princely rulers—but in fits and starts; self-interests of the various parties hampered the process over nearly a century of autocratic experimentation beginning in the era of the Napoleonic Wars which saw the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire 1806 and the subsequent rise of German nationalism. Unification exposed tensions due to religious linguistic social and cultural differences among the inhabitants of the new nation suggesting that 1871 only represented one moment in a continuum of the larger unification processes. The Holy Roman Emperor had been often called Emperor of all the Germanies; contemporary news accounts frequently referred to The Germanies and in the empire its members of higher nobility were referred to as Princes of Germany or Princes of the Germanies—for the lands once called East Francia had been organized and governed as pocket kingdoms since times before the rise of Charlemagne 800 AD. Given the mountainous terrains of much of the territory it is obvious that isolated peoples would develop cultural educational linguistic and religious differences over such a lengthy time period. Germany or the Germanies of the nineteenth century enjoyed transportation and communications improvements tying the peoples into a greater tighter culture as has the entire world under the influence of better communications and transportation infrastructures. The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation which had included more than 500 independent states was effectively dissolved when Emperor Francis II abdicated 6 August 1806 during the War of the Third Coalition. Despite the legal administrative and political disruption associated with the end of the Empire the people of the German-speaking areas of the old Empire had a common linguistic cultural and legal tradition further enhanced by their shared experience in the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. European liberalism offered an intellectual basis for unification by challenging dynastic and absolutist models of social and political organization; its German manifestation emphasized the importance of tradition education and linguistic unity of peoples in a geographic region. Economically the creation of the Prussian Zollverein customs union in 1818 and its subsequent expansion to include other states of the German Confederation reduced competition between and within states. Emerging modes of transportation facilitated business and recreational travel leading to contact and sometimes conflict among German speakers from throughout Central Europe. The model of diplomatic spheres of influence resulting from the Congress of Vienna in 1814–15 after the Napoleonic Wars endorsed Austrian dominance in Central Europe. However the negotiators at Vienna took no account of Prussia\s growing strength within and among the German states and so failed to foresee that Prussia would rise up to challenge Austria for leadership. This German dualism presented two solutions to the problem of unification: Kleindeutsche Lösung the small Germany solution Germany without Austria or Großdeutsche Lösung the greater Germany solution Germany with Austria. Historians debate whether Otto von Bismarck—Minister President of Prussia—had a master plan to expand the North German Confederation of 1866 to include the remaining independent German states into a single entity or simply to expand the power of the Kingdom of Prussia. They conclude that factors in addition to the strength of Bismarck\s Realpolitik led a collection of early modern polities to reorganize political economic military and diplomatic relationships in the 19th century. Reaction to Danish and French nationalism provided foci for expressions of German unity. Military successes—especially those of Prussia—in three regional wars generated enthusiasm and pride that politicians could harness to promote unification. This experience echoed the memory of mutual accomplishment in the Napoleonic Wars particularly in the War of Liberation of 1813–14. By establishing a Germany without Austria the political and administrative unification in 1871 at least temporarily solved the problem of dualism. ,1
425,http://dbpedia.org/resource/June_2013_Egyptian_protests,The June 2013 Egyptian protests also called June 30 Revolution were mass protests that occurred in Egypt on 30 June 2013 marking the one-year anniversary of Mohamed Morsi\s inauguration as president. The events ended with 2013 Egyptian coup d\état after millions of protesters across Egypt took to the streets and demanded the immediate resignation of the president. The rallies were partly a response to Tamarod a grassroots movement that launched a petition in April earlier that year calling for the government to step down and it claimed to have collected more than 22 million signatures. According to the Egyptian military calculated numbers counted through helicopters scanning the demonstrations\ perimeters across the country this was the biggest protest in Egypt\s history with 14 million protesters. Reasons for demanding Morsi\s resignation included accusations of increasing authoritarianism and his pushing through an Islamist agenda disregarding the predominantly secular opposition or the rule of law. The uprising concluded seven months of protests that started when the Morsi government issued a highly controversial draft constitution that gave him sweeping unlimited powers over the state\s judicial system. The demonstrations which had started peacefully turned violent when the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood were stormed in Mokattam in Cairo and when 5 members of the organization were killed amid clashes. At the same time many Morsi supporters staged a relatively smaller rally in Rabaa al-Adawiya square in Nasr City a district of Cairo. A total of 16 people were reported to have lost their lives on Sunday and approximately 200 injured as of late Tuesday during the unrest as a result of clashes between pro and anti-Morsi demonstrators according to the state-run news agency. Another 10 people were also reported to have been killed in the cities of Alexandria Marsa Matruh and Minya. On 1 July amid the chaos the country was facing the military delivered a nationwide TV and radio statement giving both the government and the opposition a 48-hour ultimatum to resolve the political crisis and meet the people\s demands or it would intervene to restore order. The following day Morsi delivered an evening speech where he declared his rejection of the declaration claiming he was the elected president who represented the will of the people. The same day another statement was released on the official Facebook page of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces titled The Final Hours that read: We swear by God that we are ready to sacrifice our blood for Egypt and its people against any terrorist extremist or fool. On the night of 3 July General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi head of the Egyptian Armed Forces announced in a live televised address that Mohamed Morsi had been deposed and replaced by the head of the constitutional court Adly Mansour and that the constitution had been suspended. Morsi was immediately detained and kept under house arrest at the Republican Guard headquarters in Cairo while several other government officials and Islamist figures supporting Morsi were also arrested. The move was widely deemed as a Revolution and it marked a turning point for the country\s future and for the fate of the Muslim Brotherhood as it was designated a terrorist group later that year in response to a bombing in Mansoura even though Ansar Bait al-Maqdis claimed responsibility and was subjected to an unprecedented crackdown amid an ongoing Islamist unrest. A crackdown by the military on the sit-in at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square led to the August 2013 Rabaa massacre which Human Rights Watch says led to the deaths of 817 people in Rabaa itself and 904 people across the country by the end of August 14. Ten members of the security forces were also killed. ,1
426,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orange_Revolution,The Orange Revolution Ukrainian: Помаранчева революція Pomarancheva revolyutsiya was a series of protests and political events that took place in Ukraine from late November 2004 to January 2005 in the immediate aftermath of the run-off vote of the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election which was claimed to be marred by massive corruption voter intimidation and direct electoral fraud. Kiev the Ukrainian capital was the focal point of the movement\s campaign of civil resistance with thousands of protesters demonstrating daily. Nationwide the democratic revolution was highlighted by a series of acts of civil disobedience sit-ins and general strikes organized by the opposition movement. The protests were prompted by reports from several domestic and foreign election monitors as well as the widespread public perception that the results of the run-off vote of 21 November 2004 between leading candidates Viktor Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych were rigged by the authorities in favour of the latter. The nationwide protests succeeded when the results of the original run-off were annulled and a revote was ordered by Ukraine\s Supreme Court for 26 December 2004. Under intense scrutiny by domestic and international observers the second run-off was declared to be fair and free. The final results showed a clear victory for Yushchenko who received about 52% of the vote compared to Yanukovych\s 44%. Yushchenko was declared the official winner and with his inauguration on 23 January 2005 in Kiev the Orange Revolution ended. In the following years the Orange Revolution had a negative connotation among pro-government circles in Belarus and Russia. In the 2010 presidential election Yanukovych became Yushchenko\s successor as Ukrainian President after the Central Election Commission and international observers declared that the presidential election was conducted fairly. Yanukovych was ousted from power four years later following the February 2014 Euromaidan clashes in Kiev\s Independence Square. Unlike the bloodless Orange Revolution these protests resulted in more than 100 deaths occurring mostly between 18 and 20 February. ,1
427,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colour_revolution,Colour revolution sometimes called the coloured revolution or color revolution is a term that was widely used by worldwide media to describe various related movements that developed in several societies in the former Soviet Union and the Balkans during the early 2000s. The term has also been applied to a number of revolutions elsewhere including in the Middle East. Some observers such as Justin Raimondo and Michael Lind have called the events a revolutionary wave the origins of which can be traced back to the 1986 People Power Revolution also known as the Yellow Revolution in the Philippines. Participants in the colour revolutions have mostly used nonviolent resistance also called civil resistance. Such methods as demonstrations strikes and interventions have been intended protest against governments seen as corrupt and/or authoritarian and to advocate democracy; and they have also created strong pressure for change. These movements generally adopted a specific colour or flower as their symbol. The colour revolutions are notable for the important role of non-governmental organisations NGOs and particularly student activists in organising creative non-violent resistance. Such movements have had a measure of success as for example in the former Yugoslavia\s Bulldozer Revolution 2000 in Georgia\s Rose Revolution 2003 and in Ukraine\s Orange Revolution 2004. In most but not all cases massive street protests followed disputed elections or requests for fair elections and led to the resignation or overthrow of leaders considered by their opponents to be authoritarian. Some events have been called color revolutions but are different from the above cases in certain basic characteristics. Examples include Lebanon\s Cedar Revolution 2005; and Kuwait\s Blue Revolution 2005. Government figures in Russia such as Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have stated that colour revolutions are a new form of warfare. President Putin said that Russia must prevent colour revolutions We see what tragic consequences the wave of so-called color revolutions led to. For us this is a lesson and a warning. We should do everything necessary so that nothing similar ever happens in Russia. ,1

431,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Revolutionary_spontaneity,Revolutionary spontaneity also known as spontaneism is a tendency to believe that social revolution can and should occur spontaneously from below without the aid or guidance of a vanguard party and that it cannot and should not be brought about by the actions of individuals or parties who might attempt to foment such a revolution. In his work What is to be Done? 1902 Vladimir Lenin argued fiercely against revolutionary spontaneity as a dangerous revisionist concept that strips away the disciplined nature of Marxist political thought and leaves it arbitrary and ineffective. Rosa Luxemburg and the Spartacist League which had attempted to overturn capitalism during the 1919 German Revolution would become main targets of Lenin\s attacks after World War I. Spontaneism however remained a popular theory in opposition to the Third International\s democratic centralism and influenced the autonomist movement in the 1970s. Its influences can be felt in some parts of today\s alter-globalization movement. ,1
432,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guatemalan_Revolution,The Guatemalan Revolution Spanish: Revolución de Guatemala was the period in Guatemalan history between the popular uprising that overthrew dictator Jorge Ubico in 1944 and the United States-orchestrated coup d\état in 1954 that unseated President Jacobo Árbenz. It is also known as the Ten Years of Spring highlighting the only years of representative democracy in Guatemala from 1930 until the end of the civil war in 1996 and included a program of agrarian reform that was enormously influential across Latin America. From the late 19th century until 1944 Guatemala was governed by a series of authoritarian rulers who sought to strengthen the economy by supporting the export of coffee. Between 1898 and 1920 Manuel Estrada Cabrera granted significant concessions to the United Fruit Company an American corporation that traded in tropical fruit and dispossessed many indigenous people of their communal lands. Under Jorge Ubico who ruled as a dictator between 1931 and 1944 this process was intensified with the institution of harsh labor regulations and a police state. In June 1944 a popular pro-democracy movement led by university students and labor organizations forced Ubico to resign. He appointed a three-person military junta to take his place led by Federico Ponce Vaides. This junta continued Ubico\s oppressive policies until it was toppled in a military coup led by Jacobo Árbenz in October 1944 an event also known as the October Revolution. The coup leaders formed a junta which swiftly called for open elections. These elections were won in a landslide by Juan José Arévalo a progressive professor of philosophy who had become the face of the popular movement. He implemented a moderate program of social reform including a widely successful literacy campaign and a largely free election process although illiterate women were not given the vote and communist parties were banned. Following the end of Arévalo\s presidency in 1951 Jacobo Árbenz was elected to the presidency in a landslide. The progressive military leader of 1944 continued Arévalo\s reforms and began an ambitious land-reform program known as Decree 900. Under it the uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500000 people benefited from the decree. The majority of them were indigenous people whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion. Árbenz\ policies ran afoul of the United Fruit Company which lost some of its uncultivated land. The company lobbied the US government for Árbenz\ overthrow and the State Department responded by engineering a coup under the pretext that Árbenz was a communist. Carlos Castillo Armas took power at the head of a military junta provoking the Guatemalan Civil War. The war lasted from 1960 to 1996 and saw the US-backed military commit genocide against the indigenous Maya peoples and widespread human rights violations against civilians. ,1

After the Shah of Iran and his regime were overthrown by revolutionaries in February 1979 Iran was in a revolutionary crisis mode from this time until 1982 or 1983. Its economy and the apparatus of government collapsed. Military and security forces were in disarray. Following the events of the revolution Marxist guerrillas and federalist parties revolted in some regions comprising Khuzistan Kurdistan and Gonbad-e Qabus which resulted in fighting between them and revolutionary forces. These revolts began in April 1979 and lasted between several months to over a year depending on the region. Recently published documents show that United States was afraid of those revolts. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski discussed with his staff about a possible American invasion of Iran by using Turkish bases and territory if the Soviets would decide to repeat the Afghanistan scenario in Iran. By 1982 or 1983 Khomeini and his supporters had crushed the rival factions and consolidated power. Elements that played a part in both the crisis and its end were the Iran hostage crisis the invasion of Iran by Saddam Hussein\s Iraq and the presidency of Abolhassan Banisadr. ,1
438,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cognitive_revolution,The cognitive revolution is the name for an intellectual movement in the 1950s that began what are known collectively as the cognitive sciences. It began in the modern context of greater interdisciplinary communication and research. The relevant areas of interchange were the combination of psychology anthropology and linguistics with approaches developed within the then-nascent fields of artificial intelligence computer science and neuroscience. A key idea in cognitive psychology was that by studying and developing successful functions in artificial intelligence and computer science it becomes possible to make testable inferences about human mental processes. This has been called the reverse-engineering approach. Important publications in setting off the cognitive revolution include George A. Miller\s 1956 Psychological Review article The Magical Number Seven Plus or Minus Two one of the most frequently cited papers in psychologyDonald Broadbent\s 1958 book Perception and Communication Noam Chomsky\s 1959 Review of Verbal Behavior by B.F. Skinner and Elements of a Theory of Human Problem Solving by Newell Shaw and Simon. Ulric Neisser\s 1967 book Cognitive Psychology was a landmark contribution. Starting in the 1960s the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies and the Center for Human Information Processing at the University of California San Diego became influential in the development of cognitive studies. By the early 1970s according to some accounts the cognitive movement had all but routed behaviorism as a psychological paradigm and by the early 1980s the cognitive approach had become the dominant research line of inquiry in most psychology research fields. ,1
439,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andijan_massacre,The Andijan massacre occurred when Uzbek Interior Ministry MVD and National Security Service SNB troops fired into a crowd of protesters in Andijan in the Republic of Uzbekistan on 13 May 2005. Estimates of those killed on 13 May range from 187 the official count of the government to several hundred. A defector from the SNB alleged that 1500 were killed. The bodies of many of those who died were allegedly hidden in mass graves following the massacre. The Uzbek government at first said the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan organized the unrest and the protesters were members of Hizb ut-Tahrir. Critics argue that the Islamist radical label is just a pretext for maintaining a repressive regime in the country. Whether troops fired indiscriminately to prevent a color revolution or acted legitimately to quell a prison break is also disputed. A third theory is that the dispute was really an inter-clan struggle for state power. The Uzbek government eventually acknowledged that poor economic conditions in the region and popular resentment played a role in the uprising. It was claimed that calls from Western governments for an international investigation prompted a major shift in Uzbek foreign policy favoring closer relations with Asian nations although the Uzbek government is known to have close ties with the US government and the Bush administration had declared Uzbekistan to be vital to US security because it hired out a large military base to US military forces. The Uzbek government ordered the closing of the United States air base in Karshi-Khanabad and improved ties with the Peoples Republic of China and Russia who supported the regimes response in Andijan. ,1

The Bavarian national uprising against the imperial occupation of 1705/06 is well-known in Germany from the episode of the Christmas massacre at Sendling and the folk tale of the Smith of Kochel. It is less well known that this uprising in Upper Bavaria was only a small part of a larger uprising which dominated huge areas of Lower Bavaria the area around the Inn River and the whole of eastern Upper Bavaria. The cities and fortresses lying in these regions were conquered and the rebellion of the peasants encroached on the Bavarian Forest and parts of the Upper Palatinate as well as Kelheim on the Danube. This the only genuine rising of the people in Bavarian history was directed against a foreign rule which oppressed the whole country after the banishment of Maximilian II Emanuel Elector of Bavaria. This genuine uprising reorganized itself as a defender of Bavaria with a large army and summoned the Braunau Parliament. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism this meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten where representatives met of the four estates: aristocracy clergy burghers and peasants. ,1

A military junta was installed to replace her; this was headed by General Jorge Rafael Videla Admiral Emilio Eduardo Massera and Brigadier-General Orlando Ramón Agosti. The junta took the official name of National Reorganization Process and remained in power until 10 December 1983. Although political repression was happening before the coup Military disappearing people and killing it was also heavily extended after the coup ended. The result of those years were more than 30.000 people forced disappearances. And many others dead killed The coup had been planned since October 1975 and the United States Department of State learned of the preparations two months before its execution. The American secretary of state Henry Kissinger would meet several times with Argentinian military leaders after the coup urging them to destroy their opponents quickly before outcry over human rights abuses grew in the United States. ,1
444,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demographic_transition,Demographic transition DT refers to the transition from high birth and death rates to lower birth and death rates as a country or region develops from a pre-industrial to an industrialized economic system. The theory was proposed in 1929 the American demographer Warren Thompson who observed changes or transitions in birth and death rates in industrialized societies over the previous 200 years. Most developed countries have completed the demographic transition and have low birth rates; most developing countries are in the process of this transition. The major relative exceptions are some poor countries mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and some Middle Eastern countries which are poor or affected by government policy or civil strife notablyPakistan Palestinian territories Yemen and Afghanistan. The demographic transition model in isolation can be taken to predict that birth rates will continue to go down as societies grow increasingly wealthy; however recent data contradict this suggesting that beyond a certain level of development birth rates increase again. In addition in the very long term the demographic transition should be reversed via evolutionary pressure for higher fertility and higher mortality. The existence of some kind of demographic transition is widely accepted in the social sciences because of the well-established historical correlation linking dropping fertility to social and economic development. Scholars debate whether industrialization and higher incomes lead to lower population or whether lower populations lead to industrialization and higher incomes. Scholars also debate to what extent various proposed and sometimes inter-related factors such as higher per-capita income higher female income lower mortality old-age security and rise of demand for human capital are involved. ,1

It is called the Secret War among the CIA Special Activities Division and Hmong veterans of the conflict. The Kingdom of Laos was a covert theatre for other belligerents during the Vietnam War. The Franco–Lao Treaty of Amity and Association signed 22 October 1953 transferred remaining French powers to the Royal Lao Government except control of military affairs establishing Laos as an independent member of the French Union. However this government did not include representatives from the Lao Issara anti-colonial armed nationalist movement. The following years were marked by a rivalry between the neutralists under Prince Souvanna Phouma the right wing under Prince Boun Oum of Champassak and the left-wing Lao Patriotic Front under Prince Souphanouvong and half-Vietnamese future Prime Minister Kaysone Phomvihane. Several attempts were made to establish coalition governments and a tri-coalition government was finally seated in Vientiane. The actual fighting in Laos involved the North Vietnamese Army U.S. Thai and South Vietnamese forces directly and through irregular proxies in a struggle for control over the Laotian Panhandle. The North Vietnamese Army occupied the area to use for its Ho Chi Minh Trail supply corridor and as staging area for offensives into South Vietnam. There was a second major theater of action on and near the northern Plain of Jars. The North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao eventually emerged victorious in 1975 as part of the general communist victory in all of former French Indochina that year. ,1

447,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkish_National_Movement,The Turkish National Movement Turkish: Türk Ulusal Hareketi encompasses the political and military activities of the Turkish revolutionaries that resulted in the creation and shaping of the modern Republic of Turkey as a consequence of the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I and the subsequent occupation of Constantinople and partitioning of the Ottoman Empire by the Allies under the terms of the Armistice of Mudros. The Ottomans saw the movement as part of an international conspiracy against them. The Turkish revolutionaries rebelled against this partitioning and against the Treaty of Sèvres signed in 1920 by the Ottoman government which partitioned portions of Anatolia itself. This establishment of an alliance of Turkish revolutionaries during the partitioning resulted in the Turkish War of Independence the abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate on the 1st November 1922 and the declaration of the Republic of Turkey on October 29 1923. The movement declared that the only source of governance for the Turkish people would be the democratic Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The movement was created in 1919 through a series of agreements and conferences throughout Anatolia and Thrace. The process was aimed to unite independent movements around the country to build a common voice and is attributed to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk as he was the primary spokesperson public figure and military leader of the movement. ,1

A combination of factors including economic hardship and failure to resist Western imperialism led many in China to be unhappy with the Qing government. When a new program to colonize Mongolia with Han Chinese and assimilate the natives was unveiled it was met with resistance that resulted in a relatively bloodless separation from the Qing Empire.

It was spearheaded by mostly younger people demonstrating on Sükhbaatar Square in the capital Ulaanbaatar. It ended with the authoritarian government resigning without bloodshed. Some of the main organizers were Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj Sanjaasürengiin Zorig Erdeniin Bat-Üül and Bat-Erdeniin Batbayar. This was the beginning of the end of the 70-year period of socialism in Mongolia. Although a multi-party system was established the Mongolian Peoples Revolutionary Party MPRP actually remained in power until 1996.

On 18 March a rebellion arose in the city of Milan and in five days of street fighting drove Marshal Radetzky and his Austrian soldiers from the city. In 1848 the Milanese launched an anti-Austrian campaign as early as the first of January. On New Years Day the Milanese started to boycott gambling and tobacco products which were Austrian monopolies and brought in over 5 million lire a year. Archduke Rainer Joseph of Austria viceroy of Lombardy and Venetia retaliated by ordering out police with cigars to provoke the crowd. The boycott culminated in a bloody street battle on the third of January when Austrian soldiers in batches of three were being insulted and pelted with stones by an angry crowd. The soldiers then gathered together in groups of a dozen and charged the crowd with swords and bayonets killing 5 and wounding another 59. Radetzky was horrified at the doings of his troops and confined them to barracks for five days. The protests were over but two months later when news reached Milan of the uprising in Vienna and the fall of Metternich the Milanese took to the streets again on 18 March. ,1

It commenced on 12 January 1848 and therefore was the very first of the numerous revolutions to occur that year. Three revolutions had previously occurred on the island of Sicily starting from 1800 against Bourbon rule: this final one resulted in an independent state surviving for 16 months. The constitution that survived the 16 months was quite advanced for its time in liberal democratic terms as was the proposal of an Italian confederation of states. It was in effect a curtain raiser to the end of the Bourbon kingdom of the Two Sicilies which was started by Giuseppe Garibaldis Expedition of the Thousand in 1860 and culminated with the Siege of Gaeta of 1860-1861. ,1

457,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breakup_of_Yugoslavia,The breakup of Yugoslavia occurred as a result of a series of political upheavals and conflicts during the early 1990s. After a period of political crisis in the 1980s constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia split apart but the unsolved issues caused bitter inter-ethnic Yugoslav wars. The wars primarily affected Bosnia and Croatia. After the Allied victory in World War II Yugoslavia was set up as a federation of six republics with borders drawn along ethnic and historical lines: Slovenia Croatia Bosnia and Herzegovina Serbia Montenegro and Macedonia. In addition two autonomous provinces were established within Serbia: Vojvodina and Kosovo. Each of the republics had its own branch of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia party and a ruling elite and any tensions were solved on the federal level. The Yugoslav model of state organization as well as a middle way between planned and liberal economy had been a relative success and the country experienced a period of strong economic growth and relative political stability up to the 1980s under the firm rule of president-for-life Josip Broz Tito. After his death in 1980 the weakened system of federal government was left unable to cope with rising economic and political challenges. In the 1980s Kosovo Albanians started to demand that their autonomous province be granted the status of a constituent republic starting with the 1981 protests. Ethnic tensions between Albanians and Kosovo Serbs remained high over the whole decade which resulted in the growth across Yugoslavia of Serb opposition to the high autonomy of provinces and ineffective system of consensus at the federal level which were seen as an obstacle for Serb interests. In 1987 Slobodan Milošević came to power in Serbia and through a series of populist moves acquired de facto control over Kosovo Vojvodina and Montenegro garnering a high level of support among Serbs for his centralist policies. Milošević was met with opposition by party leaders of the western republics of Slovenia and Croatia who also advocated greater democratization of the country in line with the Revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia dissolved in 1990 along federal lines. During 1990 the communists lost power to separatist parties in the first multi-party elections held across the country except in Serbia and Montenegro where they were won by Milošević and his allies. Nationalist rhetoric on all sides became increasingly heated. In 1991 one republic after another proclaimed independence only Serbia and Montenegro remained federated but the status of Serb minorities outside Serbia was left unsolved. After a string of inter-ethnic incidents the Yugoslav Wars ensued first in Croatia and then most severely in multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina; the wars left long-term economic and political damage in the region. ,1
458,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nonviolent_revolution,A nonviolent revolution is a revolution using mostly campaigns of civil resistance including various forms of nonviolent protest to bring about the departure of governments seen as entrenched and authoritarian. While many campaigns of civil resistance are intended for much more limited goals than revolution generally a nonviolent revolution is characterized by simultaneous advocacy of democracy human rights and national independence in the country concerned. In some cases a campaign of civil resistance with a revolutionary purpose may be able to bring about the defeat of a dictatorial regime only if it obtains a degree of support from the armed forces or at least their benevolent neutrality. An effective campaign of civil resistance and even the achievement of a nonviolent revolution may be possible in a particular case despite the controlling government taking brutal measures against protesters; the commonly held belief that most revolutions which have happened in dictatorial regimes were bloody or violent uprisings is not borne out by historical analysis. Nonviolent revolutions in the 20th century became more successful and more common especially in the 1980s as Cold War political alliances which supported status quo governance waned. In the 1970s and 1980s intellectuals in the Soviet Union and other Communist states and in some other countries began to focus on civil resistance as the most promising means of opposing entrenched authoritarian regimes. The use of various forms of unofficial exchange of information including by samizdat expanded. Two major revolutions during the 1980s strongly influenced political movements that followed. The first was the 1986 People Power Revolution in the Philippines from which the term people power came to be widely used especially in Hispanic and Asian nations. Three years later the Revolutions of 1989 that ousted communist regimes in the Eastern Bloc reinforced the concept with the notable exception of the notoriously bloody Romanian Revolution beginning with the victory of Solidarity in that years Polish legislative elections. The Revolutions of 1989 provided the template for the so-called color revolutions in mainly post-communist states which tended to use a color or flower as a symbol somewhat in the manner of the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia. In December 1989 inspired by the anti-communist revolutions in Eastern Europe the Mongolian Democratic Union MDU organized popular street protests and hunger strikes against the communist regime. In 1990 dissidents in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic started civil resistance against the government but were initially crushed by Red Army in the Black January massacre. Recent nonviolent revolutions include the Orange Revolution in Ukraine which was highlighted by a series of acts of civil disobedience sit-ins and general strikes organized by the opposition movement. ,1

461,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anti-bureaucratic_revolution,The Anti-bureaucratic revolution was a campaign of street protests ran between 1986 and 1989 in former Yugoslavia by supporters of Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević. The protests termed Rallies of Truth Serbo-Croatian: Miting istine overthrew governments of the Serbian autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo as well as the government of the Socialist Republic of Montenegro and replaced them with allies of Milošević thereby creating a dominant voting bloc within the Yugoslav presidency council. The name anti-bureaucratic revolution is derived from the proclaimed revolt against bureaucratic and corrupt governing structures but the campaign is widely considered as orchestrated by Milošević in an attempt to strengthen his power through populist Serb nationalism and the expansion of his centralised influence. The events were condemned by the communist governments of the western Yugoslav republics especially SR Slovenia and SR Croatia who successfully resisted the attempts to expand the revolution onto their territories and turned against Milošević. The rising antagonism eventually resulted in the dissolution of the ruling League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1990 and subsequently in the breakup of Yugoslavia. ,1

465,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Revolutionary_wave,A revolutionary wave is a series of revolutions occurring in various locations in a similar time period. In many cases past revolutions and revolutionary waves may inspire current ones or an initial revolution inspires other concurrent affiliate revolutions with similar aims.Historians and political philosophers have studied the causes of revolutionary waves including Robert Roswell Palmer Crane Brinton Hannah Arendt Eric Hoffer and Jacques Godechot. The concept is important to Marxists who see revolutionary waves as evidence that a world revolution is possible. For Rosa Luxemburg The most precious thing … in the sharp ebb and flow of the revolutionary waves is the proletariat\s spiritual growth. The advance by leaps and bounds of the intellectual stature of the proletariat affords an inviolable guarantee of its further progress in the inevitable economic and political struggles ahead. However the phrase also has been used by non-Marxist activists and writers including Justin Raimondo and Michael Lind to describe numbers of revolutions happening within a short period of time. Various examples of revolutionary waves are cited. ,1
466,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Die_Wende,Die Wende German pronunciation: diː ˈvɛndə] The Turn or The Turnaround is a German term that has come to signify the complete process of change from the rule of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and a centrally planned economy to the revival of parliamentary democracy and market economy in the German Democratic Republic GDR around the years 1989 and 1990. It encompasses several processes and events which later have become synonymous with the overall process. These processes and events are: \n* the under the President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev possible Peaceful Revolution a time of massive protest and demonstrations Montagsdemonstrationen – Monday demonstrations and Alexanderplatz demonstration against the political system of the GDR and for civil and human rights in the fall of 1989. \n* the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 following a press conference held by the Politbüro during which Günter Schabowski announced the opening of the border checkpoints. \n*  the transition to democracy in East Germany following the Peaceful Revolution leading to the only really democratic elections to the Volkskammer in the GDR on 18 March 1990. \n* the process of German reunification leading to the Einigungsvertrag Treaty of Unification on 31 August 1990 the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany on 12 September 1990 and finally the joining of the five re-established East German Länder to the Federal Republic of Germany. In hindsight the German word Wende meaning The Turn then took on a new meaning; the phrase seit der Wende literally since the change means since reunification or since the Wall fell. This period is marked by West German aid to East Germany a total reaching an estimated $775 billion over 10 years. To some extent Germany is still in the midst of the Nachwendezeit post-Wende period: differences between East and West still exist and a process of inner reunification is not yet finished. This fundamental change has marked the reunification of Germany. The term was first used publicly in East Germany on 18 October 1989 in a speech by interim GDR leader Egon Krenz the term having been used on the cover of influential West German news magazine Der Spiegel two days previously. Whilst it initially referred to the end of the old East German government Die Wende has become synonymous with the fall of the Wall and of the East German state and indeed of the entire Iron Curtain and Eastern Bloc state socialism. ,1
467,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Revolt_of_the_Comuneros,The Revolt of the Comuneros Spanish: Guerra de las Comunidades de Castilla War of the Communities of Castile was an uprising by citizens of Castile against the rule of Charles V and his administration between 1520 and 1521. At its height the rebels controlled the heart of Castile ruling the cities of Valladolid Tordesillas and Toledo. The revolt occurred in the wake of political instability in the Crown of Castile after the death of Queen Isabella I in 1504. Joanna the Mad Isabella\s daughter inherited the throne with her Burgundian husband King Philip I. However Philip died two years into their reign and their son Charles was only six years old. Due to his youth and Joanna\s mental instability Castile was ruled by the nobles and her father King Ferdinand II of Aragon as a regency. After Ferdinand\s death in 1516 the sixteen-year-old Charles was proclaimed king of both Castile and Aragon. Charles had been raised in the Netherlands with little knowledge of Castilian. He arrived in Spain in October 1517 accompanied by a large retinue of Flemish nobles and clerics. These factors resulted in mistrust between the new king and the Castilian social elites who could see the threat to their power and status. In 1519 Charles was elected Holy Roman Emperor. He departed for Germany in 1520 leaving the Dutch cardinal Adrian of Utrecht to rule Castile in his absence. Soon a series of anti-government riots broke out in the cities and local city councils Comunidades took power. The rebels chose Charles\ own mother Queen Joanna as an alternative ruler hoping they could control her madness. The rebel movement took on a radical anti-feudal dimension supporting peasant rebellions against the landed nobility. On April 23 1521 after nearly a year of rebellion the reorganized supporters of the emperor struck a crippling blow to the comuneros at the Battle of Villalar. The following day rebel leaders Juan de Padilla Juan Bravo and Francisco Maldonado were beheaded. The army of the comuneros fell apart. Only the city of Toledo kept alive the rebellion until its surrender in October 1521. The character of the revolution is a matter of historiographical debate. According to some scholars the revolt was one of the first modern revolutions notably because of the anti-noble sentiment against social injustice and its basis on ideals of democracy and freedom. Others consider it a more typical rebellion against high taxes and perceived foreign control. From the 19th century onwards the revolt has been mythologized by various Spaniards generally liberals who drew political inspiration from it. Conservative intellectuals have traditionally adopted more pro-Imperial stances toward the revolt and have been critical of both the motives and the government of the comuneros. With the end of Franco\s dictatorship and the establishment of the autonomous community of Castile and León positive commemoration of the Comunidades has grown. April 23 is now celebrated as Castile and León Day and the incident is often referred to in Castilian nationalism. ,1
468,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saffron_Revolution,Saffron Revolution is a term used to describe a series of economic and political protests and demonstrations that took place during August September and October 2007 in Burma also known as Myanmar. The protests were triggered by the decision of the national military government to remove subsidies on the sales prices of fuel. The national government is the only supplier of fuels and the removal of the price subsidy immediately caused diesel and petrol prices to increase by 66%--100% and the price of compressed natural gas for buses to increase 500% in less than a week. The various protests were led by students political activists including women and Buddhist monks and took the form of a campaign of nonviolent resistance sometimes also called civil resistance. In response to the protests dozens of protesters were arrested or detained. Starting in September 2007 the protests were led by thousands of Buddhist monks and those protests were allowed to proceed until a renewed government crackdown in late September 2007. Some news reports referred to the protests as the Saffron Revolution or ရွှေဝါရောင်တော်လှန်ရေး sw̥èi wà jàʊɴ tɔ̀ l̥àɴ jéi].

469,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stono_Rebellion,The Stono Rebellion sometimes called Cato\s Conspiracy or Cato\s Rebellion was a slave rebellion that began on 9 September 1739 in the colony of South Carolina. It was the largest slave uprising in the British mainland colonies with 42-47 whites and 44 blacks killed. The uprising was led by native Africans who were likely from the Central African Kingdom of Kongo. Some of the rebels spoke Portuguese. Their leader Jemmy was a literate slave; in some reports he is referred to as Cato and likely was held by the Cato or Cater family who lived near the Ashley River and north of the Stono River. He led 20 other enslaved Kongolese who may have been former soldiers in an armed march south from the Stono River for which the rebellion is named. They were bound for Spanish Florida. In an effort to destabilize British rule the Spanish had promised freedom and land at St. Augustine to slaves who escaped from the British colonies. Jemmy and his group recruited nearly 60 other slaves and killed some whites before being intercepted and defeated by South Carolina militia near the Edisto River. A group of slaves escaped and traveled another 30 miles 50 km before battling a week later with the militia. Most of the captured slaves were executed; the surviving few were sold to markets in the West Indies. In response to the rebellion the South Carolina legislature passed the Negro Act of 1740 which restricted slave assembly education and movement. It also enacted a 10-year moratorium against importing African slaves because they were considered more rebellious and established penalties against slaveholders\ harsh treatment of slaves. It required legislative approval for each act of manumission which slaveholders had previously been able to arrange privately. This sharply reduced the rate of manumissions in the state. ,1

The Zapatista uprising started in January 1994 lasting for less than two weeks before being crushed by the government. Negotiations between the government and Zapatistas allowed agreements to be signed as part of peace negotiations but these agreements were not complied with in the following years and the peace process stagnated. This resulted in an increasing division between people and communities with ties to the government and communities that sympathized with the Zapatistas. Social tensions armed conflict and para-military incidents increased culminating in the killing of 45 people in the village of Acteal in 1997 by para-militaries. Though at a low level rebel activity continues and violence occasionally erupts between Zapatista supporters and anti-Zapatista militias along with the government.

There were smaller upheavals in Switzerland Russia and Brazil. The revolutionaries in each country knew of the others and to some degree were inspired by or emulated them. Independence movements in the New World began with the American Revolution 1775–1783 in which France the Netherlands and Spain assisted the new United States of America as it secured independence from Britain. In the 1790s the Haitian Revolution broke out. With Spain tied down in European wars the mainland Spanish colonies secured independence around 1820. In long-term perspective the revolutions were mostly successful. They spread widely the ideals of republicanism the overthrow of aristocracies kings and established churches. They emphasized the universal ideals of the Enlightenment such as the equality of all men including equal justice under law by disinterested courts as opposed to particular justice handed down at the whim of a local noble. They showed that the modern notion of revolution of starting fresh with a radically new government could actually work in practice. Revolutionary mentalities were born and continue to flourish to the present day. ,1

484,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rwandan_Revolution,The Rwandan Revolution also known as the Social Revolution or Wind of Destruction Kinyarwanda: muyaga was a period of ethnic violence in Rwanda from 1959 to 1961 between the Hutu and the Tutsi two of the three ethnic groups in Rwanda. The revolution saw the country transition from a Belgian colony with a Tutsi monarchy to an independent Hutu-dominated republic. Rwanda had been ruled by a Tutsi monarchy since at least the 18th century with entrenched pro-Tutsi and anti-Hutu policies. Germany and Belgium successively controlled Rwanda through the early 20th century with both European nations ruling through the kings and perpetuating a pro-Tutsi policy. After 1945 a Hutu counter-elite developed leading to the deterioration of relations between the groups. The Tutsi leadership agitated for speedy independence to cement their power and the Hutu elite called for the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu a stance increasingly supported by the Roman Catholic Church and the colonial government. The revolution began in November 1959 with a series of riots and arson attacks on Tutsi homes following false reports of the murder of a Hutu sub-chief by Tutsi activists. Violence quickly spread throughout the country. The king and Tutsi politicians attempted a counterattack to seize power and ostracise the Hutu and the Belgians but were thwarted by Belgian colonel Guy Logiest who was brought in by the colonial governor. Logiest reestablished law and order beginning a programme to promote and protect the Hutu elite. The Belgians then replaced many Tutsi chiefs and sub-chiefs with Hutu consigning King Kigeli V to figurehead status; Kigeli later fled the country. Despite continued anti-Tutsi violence Belgium organised local elections in mid-1960. Hutu parties gained control of nearly all communes effectively ending the revolution. Logiest and Hutu leader Grégoire Kayibanda declared Rwanda an autonomous republic in 1961 and the country became independent in 1962. The revolution caused at least 336000 Tutsi to flee to neighbouring countries where they lived as refugees. Although the exiles agitated for an immediate return to Rwanda they were split between those seeking negotiation and those wishing to overthrow the new regime. Some exiles formed armed groups called inyenzi or cockroaches by the Hutu government who launched attacks into Rwanda. The largest occurred in late 1963 when a surprise attack approached Kigali. The government fought back defeating the inyenzi and killing thousands of the remaining Tutsi in Rwanda. No further threat was posed by the refugees until the 1990s when a civil war initiated by the Tutsi-refugee Front Patriotique Rwandais FPR forced the Hutu government into negotiations. This led to a rise in Hutu extremism and the 1994 genocide in which hundreds of thousands of Tutsi were killed before the FPR took control. ,1

486,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Industrious_Revolution,The Industrious Revolution is the title given to a period of time usually given as between 1600 and 1800 that led up to the Industrial Revolution. It is a term first coined by the Japanese demographic historian Akira Hayami 速水融 and accepted by other historians to help further explain the advent of the Industrial Revolution. Much of this theory deals with the spending behaviours of families in the period. It also deals with the production and consumption of goods. In fact Industrious Revolutions are often characterized by a rise in demand for market-supplied goods which will minimize the value of domestic goods before the ultimate consumption. Industrious Revolutions often occur during a period where labour wages have stagnated or decreased. The theory of a pre-industrial Industrious Revolution is contested within the history community. ,1

Demonstrations expressed the general anger against French colonial policies such as heavy taxation and state monopolies on certain goods as well as the corruption and perceived unfairness of local notables and mandarins. Demonstrators while violent and armed with little more than the most basic of farm weapons were brutally suppressed by the overwhelming military strength of the French.

493,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keynesian_Revolution,The Keynesian Revolution was a fundamental reworking of economic theory concerning the factors determining employment levels in the overall economy. The revolution was set against the then orthodox economic framework: Neoclassical economics. The early stage of the Keynesian Revolution took place in the years following the publication of Keynes\ General Theory in 1936. It saw the neoclassical understanding of employment replaced with Keynes\ view that demand and not supply is the driving factor determining levels of employment. This provided Keynes and his supporters with a theoretical basis to argue that governments should intervene to alleviate severe unemployment. With Keynes unable to take much part in theoretical debate after 1937 a process swiftly got under way to reconcile his work with the old system to form Neo-Keynesian economics a mixture of neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics. The process of mixing these schools is referred to as the neoclassical synthesis and Neo-Keynesian economics may be summarized as Keynesian in macroeconomics neoclassical in microeconomics. ,1

499,http://dbpedia.org/resource/War_of_the_Insane,The War of the Insane or the Madman\s War Guerre du Fou was a Hmong revolt against taxation in the French colonial administration in Indochina lasting from 1918 to 1921. Pa Chay Vue the leader of the revolt regularly climbed trees to receive military orders from heaven. The French granted the Hmong a special status in 1920 effectively ending the conflict. The stimulus for the rebellion was heavy taxation by the French and abuse of power by the ethnic Lao and Tai tax collectors. The Hmong people were divided into pro- and anti-French factions. The rebellion called Rog Paj Cai by the Hmong Nationalists and Rog Phim Npab by Hmong who sided with the French was a self-initiated and self-sustaining movement; all the guns were the Hmong-designed and manufactured flintlocks a bit different from the traditional western flintlock gun. The gunpowder was also of a Hmong sort salt peter charcoal and guano is used similar to western black powder but shavings from a type of tree is added to increase the explositivity. The Hmong won battle after battle in for the majority of the rebellion; the French were surprised and did not know how to fight in the jungles nor did they know how to fight a near invisible army. France was also heavily involved in World War I in Europe and resorted to using 50% French and 50% native Vietnamese Lao and Tai and traitor Hmong soldiers who all had little desire to fight the liberating Hmong forces. One particular weapon that especially scared the French army was the Hmong cannon made with the trunk of a tree and packed with metal pieces from pots and a lot of Hmong gunpowder. This cannon was designed by Kuab Chav and is said to have weighed over 200 lbs such that only one man named Lwv was able to carry it. As the French army came up the mountainous trails the cannon would spray the metal shards at the French army sending them into hiding while wounding and killing many of them. They never knew what it was because they assumed the Hmong did not have the technology to build such a weapon. The French morale was also weakened because of rumors of that Pa Chay\s army was protected by magic. As the French Army chased the Hmong army through the mountainous passes and ravines they never saw any dead Hmong soldiers. The reason was that Pa Chay had commanded his men to never leave anyone behind and to cover up the blood as quickly as possible. This gave the illusion to the French that indeed Pa Chay\s army was invincible. Kao Mee a sister of Pa Chay also played an important role. She carried a white flag made of hemp which she used to deflect bullets. She is said to have been a righteous virgin which is why the Heavens allowed her to have such miraculous powers. She led the army into many success in battle. At its height the rebellion encompassed 40000 square kilometres of Indochina from Điện Biên Phủ in Tonkin to Nam Ou in Luang Prabang and from Muong Cha north of Vientiane to Sam Neua in Laos. As World War I came to an end the French reinforcements began to outnumber and their firepower outpowered the Hmongs. They also learned from certain Hmong informants such as Lauj Kiab Toom that the Hmong gunpowder does not work well when wet so they attacked especially during the monsoon season. The Hmong believed their defeats were temporary caused by violations of the Oath to Heaven by some of the soldiers and despite these defeats there was still strong support from the populace. ,1

502,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dual_revolution,The Dual Revolution was a term first coined by Eric Hobsbawm. It refers specifically to the time period between 1789 and 1848 in which the political and ideological changes of the French Revolution fused with and reinforced the technological and economic changes of the Industrial Revolution. The French Revolution inspired by the ideals of Enlightenment philosophy spread ideas of Democracy Nationalism and Liberalism. These political ideas were fused with the new technological advances of the industrial revolution such as the spinning jenny steam engines and the puddling process. With the defeat of the French Revolution and subsequently the Congress of Vienna Metternich constructed a balance of power in Europe that would prevent one country from gaining too much power. This set the framework for a strong conservative reactionary stance against the ideas of nationalism and liberalism spread by the dual revolution. The Holy Alliance formed by Austria Prussia and Russia in September 1815 became a symbol of oppression to the ideas spread by the Dual Revolution. ,1

Student protesters founded the Federation in opposition to the official government-supported student organizations which they believed were undemocratic. Although the Federation made several demands of the government during the protests and organized multiple demonstrations in the Square its primary focus was to obtain government recognition as a legitimate organization. By seeking this recognition the Federation directly challenged the Chinese Communist Party’s authority. After failing to achieve direct dialogue with the government the Federation lost support from student protesters and its central leadership role within the Tiananmen Square protests. ,1

Charles Sellers a leading historian of the Market Revolution portrays it as a highly negative development that marked the triumph of capitalism over democracy. He argues that this was one of the most significant transformations of America within the first half of the nineteenth century—indeed the defining event of world history—the evolution from an agrarian to a capitalist society. Sellers observes: While dissolving deeply rooted patterns of behavior and belief for competitive effort it mobilized collective resources through government to fuel growth in countless ways not least by providing the essential legal financial and transport infrastructures. Establishing capitalist hegemony over economy politics and culture the market revolution created ourselves and most of the world we know. ,1
507,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Timeline_of_the_Spanish_American_wars_of_independence,This is a timeline of events related to the Spanish American wars of independence. Numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America took place during the early 19th century from 1808 until 1829 directly related to the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain. The conflict started with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville. When the Central Junta fell to the French numerous new Juntas appeared all across the Americas eventually resulting in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south to Mexico in the north. After the death of the king Ferdinand VII in 1833 only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule until the Spanish–American War in 1898. These conflicts can be characterized both as civil wars and wars of national liberation since the majority of the combatants were Spanish Americans on both sides and the goal of the conflict for one side was the independence of the Spanish colonies in the Americas. In addition the wars were related to the more general Latin American wars of independence which include the conflicts in Haiti and Brazil Brazils independence shared a common starting point with Spanish Americas since both were triggered by Napoleons invasion of the Iberian Peninsula when the Portuguese royal family resettled in Brazil. The war in Europe and the resulting absolutist restoration ultimately convinced the Spanish Americans of the need to establish independence from the mother country so various revolutions broke out in Spanish America. Moreover the process of Latin American independence took place in the general political and intellectual climate that emerged from the Age of Enlightenment and that influenced all of the so-called Atlantic Revolutions including the earlier revolutions in the United States and France. Nevertheless the wars in and the independence of Spanish America were the result of unique developments within the Spanish Monarchy. ,1

Athens had been unanimously chosen to stage the inaugural modern Games during a congress organised by Coubertin in Paris on 23 June 1894 during which the IOC was also created because Greece was the birthplace of the Ancient Olympic Games. The main venue was the Panathenaic Stadium where athletics and wrestling took place; other venues included the Neo Phaliron Velodrome for cycling and the Zappeion for fencing. The opening ceremony was held in the Panathenaic Stadium on 6 April during which most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield grouped by nation. After a speech by the president of the organising committee Crown Prince Constantine his father officially opened the Games. Afterwards nine bands and 150 choir singers performed an Olympic Hymn composed by Spyridon Samaras with words by poet Kostis Palamas. The 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success. The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. The Panathenaic Stadium the only Olympic stadium used in the 1800s overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event. After the Games Coubertin and the IOC were petitioned by several prominent figures including Greeces King George and some of the American competitors in Athens to hold all the following Games in Athens. However the 1900 Summer Olympics were already planned for Paris and except for the Intercalated Games of 1906 the Olympics did not return to Greece until the 2004 Summer Olympics 108 years later. ,1

Originally called Semaine Internationale des Sports d\Hiver International Winter Sports Week and held in association with the 1924 Summer Olympics the sports competitions were held at the foot of Mont Blanc in Chamonix and Haute-Savoie France between January 25 and February 5 1924. The Games were organized by the French Olympic Committee and were in retrospect designated by the International Olympic Committee IOC as the I Olympic Winter Games. The tradition of holding the Winter Olympics in the same year as the Summer Olympics would continue until 1992 after which the current practice of holding a Winter Olympics in the second year after each Summer Olympics began. Although Figure Skating had been an Olympic event in both London and Antwerp and Ice Hockey had been an event in Antwerp the winter sports had always been limited by the season. In 1921 at the convention of the IOC in Lausanne there was a call for equality for winter sports and after much discussion it was decided to organize an international week of winter sport in 1924 in Chamonix. ,1

The 1928 Games were the first true Winter Olympics held on its own as they were not in conjunction with a Summer Olympics. The preceding 1924 Games were retroactively renamed the inaugural Winter Olympics though they had been in fact part of the 1924 Summer Olympics. All preceding Winter Events of the Olympic Games were the winter sports part of the schedule of the Summer Games and not held as a separate Winter Games. These games also replaced the now redundant Nordic Games that were held quadrennially since early in the century. Fluctuating weather conditions made these Olympics memorable. The opening ceremony was held in a blizzard.10] In contrast warm weather conditions plagued the Olympics for the remainder of the Games requiring cancellations of one event with temperatures as high as 25 °C 77 °F. See further description at the Wikipedia main article on Winter Olympic Games. ,1
513,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1948_Summer_Olympics,The 1948 Summer Olympics officially known as the Games of the XIV Olympiad were an international multi-sport event which was held in London England United Kingdom. After a 12-year hiatus because of World War II these were the first Summer Olympics since the 1936 Games in Berlin. The 1940 Games had been scheduled for Tokyo and then for Helsinki; the 1944 Games had been provisionally planned for London. This was the second occasion that London had hosted the Olympic Games having previously been the venue in 1908. The Olympics again returned to London in 2012 making it thus far the only city to host the games three times. These were the first of two summer Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edström. The event came to be known as the Austerity Games because of the economic climate and post-war rationing. No new venues were built for the games with events taking place mainly in Wembley Stadium and the Empire Pool at Wembley Park and athletes were housed in existing accommodation in the Wembley area instead of an Olympic Village as were the 1936 Games and the subsequent 1952 Games. A record 59 nations were represented by 4104 athletes 3714 men and 390 women in 19 sport disciplines. Germany and Japan were refused permission to participate; the USSR was invited but chose not to send any athletes. The United States team won the most total medals 84 and the most gold medals 38. The host nation won 23 medals three of them gold. One of the star performers at the Games was Dutch sprinter Fanny Blankers-Koen. Dubbed The Flying Housewife the 30-year-old mother of two won four gold medals in athletics. In the decathlon American Bob Mathias became the youngest male ever to win an Olympic gold medal at the age of 17. The most individual medals were won by Veikko Huhtanen of Finland who took three golds a silver and a bronze in men\s gymnastics. ,1

The Games were the first to be celebrated after World War II; it had been 12 years since the last Winter Games in 1936. From the selection of a host city in a neutral country to the exclusion of Japan and Germany the political atmosphere of the post-war world was inescapable during the Games. The organizing committee faced several challenges due to the lack of financial and human resources consumed by the war. These were the first of two winter Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edström. There were 28 nations that marched in the opening ceremonies on January 30 1948. Nearly 670 athletes competed in 22 events in four sports. The Games also featured two demonstration sports: military patrol which later became the biathlon and winter pentathlon which was discontinued after these Games. Notable performances were turned in by figure skaters Dick Button and Barbara Ann Scott and skier Henri Oreiller. Most of the athletic venues were already in existence from the first time St. Moritz hosted the Winter Games in 1928. All of the venues were outdoors which meant the Games were heavily dependent on favorable weather conditions. ,1
515,http://dbpedia.org/resource/2002_Winter_Olympics,The 2002 Winter Olympics officially the XIX Olympic Winter Games French: Les XIXes Jeux olympiques dhiver and commonly known as Salt Lake 2002 were a winter multi-sport event that was celebrated in February 2002 in and around Salt Lake City United States. Approximately 2400 athletes from 78 nations participated in 78 events in fifteen disciplines held throughout 165 sporting sessions. The 2002 Winter Olympics and the 2002 Paralympic Games were both organized by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee SLOC. Utah became the fifth state in the United States to host the Olympic Games and the 2002 Winter Olympics are the most recent games to be held in the United States. The opening ceremony was held on February 8 2002 and sporting competitions were held up until the closing ceremony on February 24 2002. Production for both ceremonies was designed by Seven Nielsen and music for both ceremonies was directed by Mark Watters. Salt Lake City became the most populous area ever to have hosted the Winter Olympics although the two subsequent host cities populations were larger. Following a trend the 2002 Olympic Winter Games were also larger than all prior Winter Games with 10 more events than the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano Japan. The Salt Lake Games faced a bribery scandal and some local opposition during the bid as well as some sporting and refereeing controversies during the competitions. Nevertheless from sporting and business standpoints this was one of the most successful Winter Olympiads in history; records were set in both the broadcasting and marketing programs. Over 2 billion viewers watched more than 13 billion viewer-hours. The Games were also financially successful raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior Olympic Games which left SLOC with a surplus of $40 million. The surplus was used to create the Utah Athletic Foundation which maintains and operates many of the remaining Olympic venues. U.S. Federal subsidies amounted to $1.3 billion. ,1
516,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1904_Summer_Olympics,The 1904 Summer Olympics officially known as the Games of the III Olympiad was an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in St. Louis Missouri in the United States from August 29 until September 3 1904 as part of an extended sports program lasting from July 1 to November 23 1904 at what is now known as Francis Field on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis. It was the first time that the Olympic Games were held in a majority English language nation and the first time that they were held outside of Europe. European tension caused by the Russo-Japanese War and the difficulty of getting to St. Louis kept most of the worlds top athletes away. Only 62 of the 650 athletes who competed came from outside of North America and only 12-15 nations were represented in all. 80% of competitors were from the United States and in over half of the events these were the only competitors. In some cases the U.S. national championship was combined with the Olympic championship. ,1
517,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1968_Winter_Olympics,The 1968 Winter Olympics officially known as the X Olympic Winter Games French: Les Xes Jeux olympiques dhiver were a winter multi-sport event which was celebrated in 1968 in Grenoble France and opened on 6 February. Thirty-seven countries participated. Norway won the most medals the first time a country other than the USSR had done so since the USSR first entered the Winter Games in 1956. Frenchman Jean-Claude Killy won three gold medals in all the alpine skiing events. In womens figure skating Peggy Fleming won the only United States gold medal. The games have been credited with making the Winter Olympics more popular in the United States not least of which because of ABCs extensive coverage of Fleming and Killy who became overnight sensations among teenage girls. The year 1968 marked the first time the IOC first permitted East and West Germany to enter separately and the first time the IOC ever ordered drug and gender testing of competitors. ,1

It was the last Olympics to issue solid gold medals and with Japans debut the first time an Asian nation participated. Stockholm was the only bid for the games and was selected in 1909. The games were the first to have art competitions womens diving womens swimming and the first to feature both the decathlon and the new pentathlon both won by Jim Thorpe. Electric timing was introduced in athletics while the host country disallowed boxing. Figure skating was rejected by the organizers because they wanted to promote the Nordic Games.United States won the most gold medals 25 while Sweden won the most medals overall 65. ,1

No fixed host city was proposed at the time. The 1916 Summer Olympics to be held in Berlin capital of the German Empire were cancelled due to World War I. The aftermath of the war and the Paris Peace Conference 1919 affected the Olympic Games not only due to new states being created but also by sanctions against the nations that lost the war and were blamed for starting it. Hungary Germany Austria Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire were banned from competing in the Games. Germany did not return to Olympic competition until 1928 and instead hosted a series of games called Deutsche Kampfspiele starting with the Winter edition of 1922 which predated the first Winter Olympics. The Sailing events were held in Ostend Belgium and two in Amsterdam Netherlands. ,1
521,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1924_Summer_Olympics,The 1924 Summer Olympics French: Les Jeux olympiques dété de 1924 officially known as the Games of the VIII Olympiad were an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in 1924 in Paris France. It was the second time Paris hosted the games after 1900. The selection process for the 1924 Summer Olympics consisted of six bids and Paris was selected ahead of Amsterdam Barcelona Los Angeles Prague and Rome. The selection was made at the 20th IOC Session in Lausanne in 1921. The cost of the Games of the VIII Olympiad was estimated to be 10000000₣. With total receipts at 5496610₣ the Olympics resulted in a hefty loss despite crowds that reached 60000 people at a time. ,1

They were the third Olympic Games and second winter Olympics to be held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo. Nagano is so far the southernmost city to host a Winter Olympics next to Squaw Valley host of the 1960 Winter Olympics. The games were succeeded by the 1998 Winter Paralympics from 5 to 14 March. These were the final Winter Olympic Games under the IOC Presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch. ,1
523,http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_Winter_Olympics,The 2014 Winter Olympics officially called the XXII Olympic Winter Games French: Les XXIIes Jeux olympiques dhiver Russian: XXII Олимпийские зимние игры tr. XXII Olimpiyskiye zimniye igry and commonly known as Sochi 2014 were a major international multi-sport event held from 7 to 23 February 2014 in Sochi Krasnodar Krai Russia with opening rounds in certain events held on the eve of the opening ceremony 6 February 2014. Both the Olympics and 2014 Winter Paralympics were organized by the Sochi Organizing Committee SOOC. Sochi was selected as the host city in July 2007 during the 119th IOC Session held in Guatemala City. It was the first Olympics in Russia since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Soviet Union was the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. A total of 98 events in 15 winter sport disciplines were held during the Games. A number of new competitions—a total of 12 accounting for gender—were held during the Games including biathlon mixed relay womens ski jumping mixed-team figure skating mixed-team luge half-pipe skiing ski and snowboard slopestyle and snowboard parallel slalom. The events were held around two clusters of new venues: an Olympic Park constructed in Sochis Imeretinsky Valley on the coast of the Black Sea with Fisht Olympic Stadium and the Games indoor venues located within walking distance and snow events in the resort settlement of Krasnaya Polyana. In preparation organizers focused on modernizing the telecommunications electric power and transportation infrastructures of the region. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion various factors caused the budget to expand to over US$51 billion surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing making Sochi the most expensive Olympics in history. The lead-up to these Games was marked by several major controversies including allegations that corruption among officials led to the aforementioned cost overruns concerns for the safety of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender LGBT athletes and spectators due to recent government actions protests by ethnic Circassian activists over the site of Sochi where they believe a genocide took place in the 19th century and threats by jihadist groups tied to the insurgency in the North Caucasus. However following the closing ceremony commentators evaluated the Games to have been successful overall. ,1
524,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1936_Summer_Olympics,The 1936 Summer Olympics German: Olympische Sommerspiele 1936 officially known as the Games of the XI Olympiad was an international multi-sport event that was held in 1936 in Berlin Germany. Berlin won the bid to host the Games over Barcelona Spain on 26 April 1931 at the 29th IOC Session in Barcelona two years before the Nazis came to power. It marked the second and final time the International Olympic Committee gathered to vote in a city that was bidding to host those Games. To outdo the Los Angeles games of 1932 Germany built a new 100000-seat track and field stadium six gymnasiums and many other smaller arenas. The games were the first to be televised and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries. Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $7 million. Her film titled Olympia pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports. Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and the official Nazi party paper the Völkischer Beobachter wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games. When threatened with a boycott of the Games by other nations Hitler appeared to allow athletes of other ethnicities from other countries to participate. However German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part by a variety of methods and Jewish athletes from other countries notably the US seem to have been side-lined in order not to offend the Nazi government. Total ticket revenues were 7.5 million Reichsmark generating a profit of over one million marks. The official budget did not include outlays by the city of Berlin which issued an itemized report detailing its costs of 16.5 million marks or outlays of the German national government which did not make its costs public but is estimated to have spent US$30 million. Jesse Owens won four gold medals in the sprint and long jump events and became the most successful athlete to compete in Berlin while the host country was the most successful country overall with 89 medals total with the United States coming in second with 56 medals. These were the final Olympics under the presidency of Henri de Baillet-Latour and the final Olympic Games for 12 years because of World War II. The next Olympic Games would be held in 1948 the Winter in Switzerland and then the Summer in London. ,1

Amsterdam had bid for the 1920 and 1924 Olympic Games but had to give way to wartorn Antwerp Belgium and Pierre de Coubertins Paris respectively. The only other candidate city for the 1928 Games was Los Angeles which would host the Olympics four years later. The United States Olympic Committee measured the costs and revenue of the 1928 Games in preparation for the 1932 Summer Olympics. The committee reported a total cost of US$1.183 million with receipts of US$1.165 million for a loss of US$18000—much less than that of the previous Games. ,1

Fewer than half the participants of the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam returned to compete in 1932. Even U.S. President Herbert Hoover skipped the event. The organizing committee put no record of the finances of the Games in their report though contemporary newspapers reported that the Games had made a profit of US$1000000. ,1

Tokyo had been awarded the organization of the 1940 Summer Olympics but this honor was subsequently passed to Helsinki because of Japans invasion of China before ultimately being canceled because of World War II. The 1964 Summer Games were the first Olympics held in Asia and the first time South Africa was barred from taking part due to its apartheid system in sports. South Africa was however allowed to compete at the 1964 Summer Paralympics also held in Tokyo where it made its Paralympic Games debut. Tokyo was chosen as the host city during the 55th IOC Session in West Germany on May 26 1959. These games were also the first to be telecast internationally without the need for tapes to be flown overseas as they had been for the 1960 Olympics four years earlier. The games were telecast to the United States using Syncom 3 the first geostationary communication satellite and from there to Europe using Relay 1. These were also the first Olympic Games to have color telecasts albeit partially. Certain events like the sumo wrestling and judo matches sports huge in Japan were tried out using Toshibas new color transmission system but only for the domestic market. History surrounding the 1964 Olympics was chronicled in the 1965 documentary film Tokyo Olympiad directed by Kon Ichikawa. The games were scheduled for mid-October to avoid the citys midsummer heat and humidity and the September typhoon season. The previous Olympics in Rome in 1960 started in late August and experienced hot weather. The following games in 1968 in Mexico City also began in October. The 1964 Olympics were also the last to use a traditional cinder track for the track events. A smooth synthetic all-weather track was used for the first time at the 1968 Olympics and at every Games thereafter. The Olympic Games of 2020 will be held in Tokyo again. ,1

These were the first Olympic Games to be staged in Latin America and the first to be staged in a Spanish-speaking country. They were also the first Games to use an all-weather smooth track for track and field events instead of the traditional cinder track. The 1968 Games were the third to be held in the last quarter of the year after the 1956 Games in Melbourne and the 1964 Games in Tokyo. The Mexican Student Movement of 1968 happened concurrently and the Olympic Games were correlated to the governments repression. ,1
533,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1972_Summer_Olympics,The 1972 Summer Olympics German: Olympische Sommerspiele 1972 officially known as the Games of the XX Olympiad was an international multi-sport event held in Munich West Germany from August 26 to September 11 1972. The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the Munich massacre in which eleven Israeli athletes and coaches and a West German police officer were murdered. Five Black September Palestinian terrorists died. The 1972 Summer Olympics were the second Summer Olympics to be held in Germany after the 1936 Games in Berlin which had taken place under the Nazi regime. Mindful of the connection the West German Government was eager to take the opportunity of the Munich Olympics to present a new democratic and optimistic Germany to the world as shown by the Games\ official motto Die Heiteren Spiele or the cheerful Games. The logo of the Games was a blue solar logo the Bright Sun by Otl Aicher the designer and director of the visual conception commission. The Olympic mascot the dachshund Waldi was the first officially named Olympic mascot. The Olympic Fanfare was composed by Herbert Rehbein a companion of Bert Kaempfert. The Olympic Park Olympiapark is based on Frei Otto\s plans and after the Games became a Munich landmark. The competition sites designed by architect Günther Behnisch included the Olympic swimming hall the Olympics Hall Olympiahalle a multipurpose facility and the Olympic Stadium Olympiastadion and an Olympic village very close to the park. The design of the stadium was considered revolutionary with sweeping canopies of acrylic glass stabilized by metal ropes used on such a large scale for the first time. ,1

Montreal was awarded the rights to the 1976 Games on May 12 1970 at the 69th IOC Session in Amsterdam over the bids of Moscow and Los Angeles. It is so far the only Summer Olympic Games to be held in Canada. Calgary and Vancouver later hosted the Winter Olympic Games in 1988 and 2010 respectively. Twenty-nine countries mostly African boycotted the Montreal Games when the International Olympic Committee IOC refused to ban New Zealand after the New Zealand national rugby union team had toured South Africa earlier in 1976 in defiance of the United Nations calls for a sporting embargo. ,1

Igry XXII Olimpiady was an international multi-sport event held in Moscow Soviet Union in present-day Russia. The 1980 Games were the first Olympic Games to be staged in Eastern Europe and remain the only Summer Olympics held there. They were also the first Olympic Games to be held in a socialist country and the only Summer Games to be held in such a country until the 2008 edition in Beijing China. These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC Presidency of Michael Morris 3rd Baron Killanin. Led by the United States at the insistence of US President Jimmy Carter 65 countries boycotted the games because of the Soviet war in Afghanistan though some athletes from some of the boycotting countries participated in the games under the Olympic Flag. This prompted the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics. ,1
536,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1984_Summer_Olympics,The 1984 Summer Olympics officially known as the Games of the XXIII Olympiad was an international multi-sport event held in Los Angeles California United States in 1984. When Tehran the only other interested city on the international level declined to bid due to the concurrent Iranian political and social changes the IOC awarded Los Angeles the Games by default. This was the second occasion Los Angeles hosted the games the first being in 1932. In response to the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow 14 Eastern Bloc countries including the Soviet Union Cuba and East Germany boycotted the Games; only Romania and Yugoslavia elected to attend. For differing reasons Iran and Libya also boycotted. The USSR announced its intention not to participate on May 8 1984 citing security concerns and chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States. Boycotting countries organized another large event in June–September 1984 called the Friendship Games; however not even a single competition was held between July 28 and August 12. Representatives of the organizing countries the Soviets in particular underlined it was not held to replace the Olympics. Elite athletes from the U.S. and USSR would only compete against each other at the 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow organized in response to the boycotts. Where ambitious construction for the 1976 games in Montreal and 1980 games in Moscow had saddled organizers with expenses greatly in excess of revenues Los Angeles strictly controlled expenses by using existing facilities except a swim stadium and a velodrome that were paid for by corporate sponsors. The Olympic Committee led by Peter Ueberroth used some of the profits to endow the LA84 Foundation to promote youth sports in Southern California educate coaches and maintain a sports library. The 1984 Summer Olympics are often considered the most financially successful modern Olympics. The host state of California was the home state of U.S. President Ronald Reagan who officially opened the Games. He had served as Governor of California from 1967 to 1975. The official mascot of the Los Angeles Games was Sam the Olympic Eagle. The logo of the games featured five blue white and red stars arranged horizontally and struck through with alternating streaks; it was named Stars in Motion. These were the first Summer Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch. On July 18 2009 a 25th anniversary celebration was held in the main stadium. This celebration included a speech by the former president of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee Ueberroth and a re-creation of the lighting of the cauldron. ,1

North Korea still officially at war with South Korea and its allies Albania who declared an Olympic-record fourth consecutive boycott Ethiopia Cuba Madagascar and Seychelles boycotted the games. Nicaragua boycotted the games because the U.S military support to the Contra rebels. However the much larger boycotts seen in the previous three Summer Olympics were avoided resulting in the largest ever number of participating nations during the Cold War era. ,1

A record 197 nations all current IOC member nations took part in the Games comprising 10318 athletes. The International Olympic Committee voted in 1986 to separate the Summer and Winter Games which had been held in the same year since 1924 and place them in alternating even-numbered years beginning in 1994. The 1996 Summer Games were the first to be staged in a different year from the Winter Games. Atlanta became the fourth American city to host the Olympic Games and the third to hold a Summer Olympic Games. ,1

It was the second time that the Summer Olympics were held in Australia and also the Southern Hemisphere the first being in Melbourne Victoria in 1956. Sydney was selected as the host city for the 2000 games in 1993. Teams from 199 countries participated. The United States won the most medals with 93 while Australia came in 4th with 58. The games cost was estimated to be A$6.6 billion. The Games received universal acclaim with the organisation volunteers sportsmanship and Australian public being lauded in the international media. Bill Bryson from The Times called the Sydney Games one of the most successful events on the world stage saying that they couldn\t be better. James Mossop of the Electronic Telegraph called the Games in an article such a success that any city considering bidding for future Olympics must be wondering how it can reach the standards set by Sydney while Jack Todd in the Montreal Gazette suggested that the IOC should quit while it\s ahead. Admit there can never be a better Olympic Games and be done with it as Sydney was both exceptional and the best. In preparing for the 2012 Olympic Games in London Lord Coe declared the Sydney Games the benchmark for the spirit of the Games unquestionably and admitting that the London organising committee attempted in a number of ways to emulate what the Sydney Organising Committee did. These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch. These were also the second Olympic Games to be held in spring. The final medal tally was led by the United States followed by Russia and China with host Australia at fourth place overall. Several World and Olympic records were broken during the games. With little or no controversies the games were deemed generally successful with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world. ,1

There were 301 medal events in 28 different sports. Athens 2004 marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance. 2004 marked the return of the games to the city where they began. A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since the 1928 Games. This rectified the long lasting mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue. The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium. The 2004 summer games were hailed as unforgettable dream games by IOC President Jacques Rogge and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure including a new airport ring road and subway system. The cost of the 2004 Athens Summer Games has been cited as a contributor to the Greek government-debt crisis. Many of the venues lie vacant and rotting; the Independent newspaper reports as many as 21 out of 22 are unused. The final medal tally was led by the United States followed by China and Russia with host Greece at 15th place. Several World and Olympics records were broken during the games. Several concerns were raised over the preparations of the Games and these included excessive budget overruns infrastructural compromise and delays in construction of the main Games\ venues. The games were deemed generally successful with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world. ,1

A total of 10942 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees NOCs competed in 28 sports and 302 events a total of one event more than the schedule of the 2004 Games. China became the 22nd nation to host the Olympic Games and the 18th to hold a Summer Olympic Games. It was the third time that the Summer Olympic Games were held in East Asia and Asia after Tokyo Japan in 1964 and Seoul South Korea in 1988. The equestrian events were held in Hong Kong making it the third time the events of the same Olympics were held under the jurisdiction of two different NOCs while sailing was contested in Qingdao and football events took place in several different cities. Beijing was awarded the Games over four competitors on 13 July 2001 having won a majority of votes from members of the International Olympic Committee IOC after two rounds of voting. The Government of the People\s Republic of China promoted the Games and invested heavily in new facilities and transportation systems. A total of 37 venues were used to host the events including 12 constructed specifically for use at the Games. The official logo of these Olympic Games titled Dancing Beijing refers to the host city by featuring a stylized calligraphic character jīng 京 meaning capital. The Games were the most watched Olympics in history attracting 4.7 billion viewers worldwide. Some politicians and non-governmental organizations criticized the choice of China as Olympic host because of the country\s human rights record and protests by critics of China\s human rights record with particular focus on Tibet marred the international portion of the Olympic torch relay. There were 43 world records and 132 Olympic records set at the 2008 Summer Olympics. An unprecedented 86 countries won at least one medal during the Games. Chinese athletes won the most gold medals with 51 and 100 medals altogether while the United States had the most total medals with 110.

These games were originally scheduled to be held in Rome but were re-located on financial grounds following a disastrous eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906. They were the fourth chronological modern Olympic Games in keeping with the now-accepted four-year cycle as opposed to the proposed Intercalated Games alternate four-year cycle. The IOC president for these Games was Baron Pierre de Coubertin. Lasting a total of 187 days or 6 months and 4 days these games were the longest in modern Olympics history. ,1
544,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1932_Winter_Olympics,The 1932 Winter Olympics officially known as the III Olympic Winter Games were a winter multi-sport event in the United States held in Lake Placid New York. The games opened on February 4 and closed on February 15. It was the first of four Winter Olympics held in the United States; Lake Placid hosted again in 1980. The games were originally to take place in Wrightwood and Big Pines California. The largest ski jump in the world was constructed in Big Pines for the event. But poor snow conditions caused Olympic officials to move the event to Lake Placid. ,1
545,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1960_Winter_Olympics,The 1960 Winter Olympics was a winter multi-sport event held between February 18–28 1960 in Squaw Valley California United States. Squaw Valley was chosen to host the Games at the 1956 meeting of the International Olympic Committee IOC. It was an undeveloped resort in 1955 so from 1956 to 1960 the infrastructure and all of the venues were built at a cost of US$80000000. It was designed to be intimate allowing spectators and competitors to walk to nearly all the venues. Squaw Valley hosted athletes from thirty nations who competed in four sports and twenty-seven events. Womens speed skating and biathlon made their Olympic debuts. The organizers decided the bobsled events did not warrant the cost to build a venue so for the first and only time bobsled was not on the Winter Olympic program. The Soviet Union dominated the medal count winning twenty-one medals seven of which were gold. Soviet speed skaters Yevgeny Grishin and Lidiya Skoblikova won two gold medals each. Swedish cross-country skier Sixten Jernberg added a gold and silver to the four medals he won at the 1956 Winter Games. Cold War politics forced the IOC to debate the participation of China Taiwan North Korea and East Germany. In 1957 the United States government threatened to deny visas to athletes from Communist countries. The IOC responded with a threat to revoke Squaw Valleys right to host the 1960 Games. The United States conceded and allowed entry to athletes from Communist countries. ,1
546,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1900_Summer_Olympics,The 1900 Summer Olympics French: Les Jeux olympiques dété de 1900 today officially known as the Games of the II Olympiad was an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in 1900 in Paris France and the last Summer Olympics to be held in the 19th century. No opening or closing ceremonies were held; competitions began on May 14 and ended on October 28. The Games were held as part of the 1900 Worlds Fair. In total 997 competitors took part in 19 different sports. Women took part in the games for the first time and sailor Hélène de Pourtalès became the first female Olympic champion. The decision to hold competitions on a Sunday brought protests from many American athletes who travelled as representatives of their colleges and were expected to withdraw rather than compete on their religious day of rest. At the Sorbonne conference of 1894 Pierre de Coubertin proposed that the Olympic Games should take place in 1900 in Paris. The delegates to the conference were unwilling to wait six years and lobbied to hold the first games in 1896. A decision was made to hold the first Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens and that Paris would host the second celebration. Most of the winners in 1900 did not receive medals but were given cups or trophies. Professionals competed in fencing and Albert Robert Ayat France who won the épée for amateurs and masters was awarded a prize of 3000 francs. Some unusual events were contested for the only time in the history of the Games including automobile and motorcycle racing ballooning cricket croquet Basque pelota and 200m swimming obstacle race and underwater swimming. This was also the only Olympic Games in history to use live animals pigeons as targets during the shooting event. ,1

Germany also hosted the Summer Olympics the same year in Berlin. 1936 is the last year in which the Summer and Winter Games were both held in the same country the cancelled 1940 games would have been held in Japan with that country likewise hosting the Winter and Summer games. The 1936 Winter Olympics were organized on behalf of the German League of the Reich for Physical Exercise DRL by Karl Ritter von Halt. Von Halt had been named President of the Committee for the organization of the Fourth Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen by Reichssportführer Hans von Tschammer und Osten. ,1
548,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1952_Winter_Olympics,The 1952 Winter Olympics Norwegian: Vinter-OL 1952 officially known as the VI Olympic Winter Games French: Les VIes Jeux olympiques d\hiver took place in Oslo Norway from 14 to 25 February. Discussions about Oslo hosting the Winter Olympic Games began as early as 1935; the city wanted to host the 1948 Games but World War II made that impossible. Instead Oslo won the right to host the 1952 Games in a contest that included Cortina d\Ampezzo in Italy and Lake Placid in the United States. All of the venues were in Oslo\s metropolitan area except for the alpine skiing events which were held at Norefjell 113 km 70 mi from the capital. A new hotel was built for the press and dignitaries along with three dormitories to house athletes and coaches creating the first modern athlete\s village. The city of Oslo bore the financial burden of hosting the Games in return for the revenue they generated. The Games attracted 694 athletes representing 30 countries who participated in four sports and 22 events. Japan and Germany made their returns to winter Olympic competition after being forced to miss the 1948 Games in the aftermath of World War II. Germany was represented solely by West German athletes because East Germany declined to compete as a unified team. Portugal and New Zealand made their Winter Olympic debuts and for the first time women were allowed to compete in cross-country skiing. Norwegian truck driver Hjalmar Andersen won three out of four speed skating events to become the most decorated athlete at the Games. Germany resumed its former prominence in bobsleigh with wins in the four- and two-man events. Dick Button of the United States performed the first triple jump in international competition to claim his second consecutive men\s figure skating Olympic title. The 1952 Games featured one demonstration sport bandy but only three Nordic countries competed in the tournament. Norway dominated the overall medal count with 16 medals seven of them gold. The Games closed with the presentation of a flag that would be passed from one Winter Olympics host city to the next. The flag which became known as the Oslo flag has been displayed in the host city during each subsequent Winter Games. ,1
549,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1956_Winter_Olympics,The 1956 Winter Olympics officially known as the VII Olympic Winter Games French: Les VIIes Jeux olympiques dhiver Italian: VII Giochi olimpici invernali was a winter multi-sport event celebrated in Cortina dAmpezzo Italy. This celebration of the Games was held from 26 January to 5 February 1956. Cortina which had originally been awarded the 1944 Winter Olympics beat out Montreal Colorado Springs and Lake Placid for the right to host the 1956 Games. The Cortina Games were unique in that many of the venues were within walking distance of each other. The organising committee received financial support from the Italian government for infrastructure improvements but the rest of the costs for the Games had to be privately financed. Consequently the organising committee was the first to rely heavily on corporate sponsorship for funding. Thirty-two nations—the largest number of participating Winter Olympic countries to that point—competed in the four sports and twenty-four events. The Soviet Union made its Winter Olympics debut and won more medals than any nation. Austrian Toni Sailer became the first person to sweep all three alpine skiing events in a single Olympics. The figure skating competition was held outdoors for the last time at these Games. Logistically the only problem encountered was a lack of snow at the alpine skiing events. To remedy this the Italian army transported large amounts of snow to ensure the courses were adequately covered. Politics did not impact the 1956 Winter Games as at the Summer Games in Melbourne Australia where the Soviet response to the Hungarian Uprising and the Suez War caused many nations to boycott the Games. The Cortina Olympics were the first Winter Olympics televised to a multi-national audience. Since Communist countries had superior technology western European countries like Finland and a few isolated geographic areas of West Germany and Austria were only able to receive Communist broadcasts of the Games. This was perceived to be a significant win for the Soviets in the propaganda front of the Cold War even though western Europe including most of West Germany and Austria was receiving the Eurovision broadcast signal. ,1

This was the second time the Upstate New York village hosted the Games after 1932. The only other candidate city to bid for the Games was Vancouver-Garibaldi British Columbia Canada; which withdrew before the final vote. The mascot of the Games was Roni a raccoon. The mask-like rings on a raccoon\s face recall the goggles and hats worn by many athletes in winter sports. The sports were played at the Olympic Center Whiteface Mountain Mt. Van Hoevenberg Olympic Bobsled Run the Olympic Ski Jumps the Cascade Cross Country Ski Center and the Lake Placid High School Speed Skating Oval. ,1

Other candidate cities were Sapporo Japan; and Gothenburg Sweden. It was the first Winter Olympics held in a Communist state. It was also the second Olympics overall as well as the second consecutive Olympics to be held in a Communist nation after the 1980 Summer Olympics were held in Moscow Soviet Union. The only other games that have since been held in a communist state are the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing and 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing and the 2022 Winter Olympics which will be held in Beijing. All of these have been in China. ,1
554,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1988_Winter_Olympics,The 1988 Winter Olympics officially known as the XV Olympic Winter Games French: Les XVes Jeux olympiques d\hiver was a Winter Olympics multi-sport event celebrated in and around Calgary Alberta Canada between February 13 and 28 1988. The host city was selected in 1981 over Falun Sweden and Cortina d\Ampezzo Italy. Most events took place in Calgary while several skiing events were held in the mountain resorts of Nakiska and Canmore west of the city. A then-record 57 nations competed and 1423 athletes participated. The Soviet Union won the most medals with 29 followed by East Germany with 25. As it had in Montreal in 1976 Canada again failed to win a gold medal in an official medal event as the host nation. Finnish ski jumper Matti Nykänen and Dutch speed skater Yvonne van Gennip were individual medal leaders capturing three gold medals apiece. The games are also remembered for the heroic failure of British ski jumper Eddie The Eagle Edwards and the Winter Olympic début of the Jamaica national bobsled team both of which would be subjects of major feature films about their participation in the games. The Calgary games were at the time one of the most expensive Olympics ever held but the organizing committee turned record television and sponsorship revenue into a net surplus that was used to maintain the facilities built for the Olympics and develop the Calgary region into the heart of Canada\s elite winter sports program. The five purpose-built venues continue to be used in their original functions and have helped the country develop into one of the top nations in Winter Olympic competition; Canada more than quintupled the five medals it won in Calgary at the 2010 games the next Winter Olympics hosted on Canadian soil. ,1

Lillehammer failed to win the bid for the 1992 event. Lillehammer was awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics in 1988 after beating Anchorage United States; Östersund Sweden; and Sofia Bulgaria. Lillehammer is the northernmost city to ever host the Winter Games. The Games were the first to be held in a different year from the Summer Olympics the first and only one to be held two years after the previous winter games and the most recent to be held in a small town. The Games were the second winter event hosted in Norway after the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo and the fourth Olympics in the Nordic countries after the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm Sweden and the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki Finland. While many events took place in Lillehammer skating took place in Hamar some ice hockey matches were placed in Gjøvik while Alpine skiing was held in Øyer and Ringebu. Sixty-seven countries and 1737 athletes participated in six sports and sixty-one events. Fourteen countries made their debut in the Winter Olympics of which nine were former Soviet republics. The Games also saw the introduction of stricter qualifying rules reducing the number of under-performing participants from warm-weather countries. New events were two new distances in short track speed skating and aerials while speed skating was moved indoors. Nearly two million people spectated the games which were the first to have the Olympic truce in effect. The games were succeeded by the 1994 Winter Paralympics from 10 to 19 March. Manuela Di Centa and Lyubov Yegorova dominated womens cross-country skiing taking five and four medals respectively. A crowd of over 100000 saw Italy beat Norway by 0.4 seconds on the mens 4 x 10 km relay.

Approximately 2600 athletes from 82 nations participated in 86 events in fifteen disciplines. Both the Olympic and Paralympic Games were organized by the Vancouver Organizing Committee VANOC headed by John Furlong. The 2010 Winter Olympics were the third Olympics hosted by Canada and the first by the province of British Columbia. Previously Canada hosted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal Quebec and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary Alberta. Vancouver is the largest city to host the Winter Olympics. Following Olympic tradition then-Vancouver mayor Sam Sullivan received the Olympic flag during the closing ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin Italy. The flag was raised on February 28 2006 in a special ceremony and was on display at Vancouver City Hall until the Olympic opening ceremony. The event was officially opened by Governor General Michaëlle Jean who was accompanied by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge. For the first time Canada won gold in an official sport at an Olympic Games hosted at home having failed to do so at both the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary although Canada won a gold medal in the demonstration sport of curling in Calgary. Canada clinched their first gold medal on the second day of the competition and first topped the gold medal tally on the second to last day of competition and went on to become the first host nation since Norway in 1952 to lead the gold medal count. With 14 Canada broke the record for the most gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics which was 13 set by the former Soviet Union in 1976 and Norway in 2002. The United States won the most medals in total their second time doing so at the Winter Olympics and broke the record for the most medals won at a single Winter Olympics with 37 a record held up to then by Germany in 2002 with 36 medals. Athletes from Slovakia and Belarus won the first Winter Olympic gold medals for their nations. ,1

The first event the group stage in womens football began on 25 July at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff followed by the opening ceremonies on 27 July. 10768 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees NOCs participated. Following a bid headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe and then-Mayor of London Ken Livingstone London was selected as the host city on 6 July 2005 during the 117th IOC Session in Singapore defeating bids from Moscow New York City Madrid and Paris. London is the first and only city thus far to host the modern Olympic Games three times having previously done so in 1908 and in 1948. Construction for the Games involved considerable redevelopment with an emphasis on sustainability. The main focus was a new 200-hectare 490-acre Olympic Park constructed on a former industrial site at Stratford East London. The Games also made use of venues that already existed before the bid. The Games received widespread acclaim for their organisation with the volunteers the British military and public enthusiasm praised particularly highly. The opening ceremony directed by Danny Boyle received widespread acclaim throughout the world particular praise from the British public and a minority of widely ranging criticisms from some social media sites. During the Games Michael Phelps became the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time winning his 22nd medal. Saudi Arabia Qatar and Brunei entered female athletes for the first time so that every currently eligible country has sent a female competitor to at least one Olympic Games. Womens boxing was included for the first time thus the Games became the first at which every sport had female competitors. These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Jacques Rogge. The final medal tally was led by the United States followed by China and host Great Britain. Several world and Olympic records were set at the games. Though there were several controversies the 2012 games were deemed highly successful with the rising standards of competition amongst nations across the world packed stadiums and smooth organisation. Furthermore the focus on sporting legacy and post-games venue sustainability was seen as a blueprint for future Olympics. ,1
559,http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_Summer_Olympics,The 2016 Summer Olympics Portuguese: Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2016 officially known as the Games of the XXXI Olympiad and commonly known as Rio 2016 was a major international multi-sport event held in Rio de Janeiro Brazil from 5 August to 21 August 2016. More than 11000 athletes from 207 National Olympic Committees including first time entrants Kosovo South Sudan and the Refugee Olympic Team took part. With 306 sets of medals the games featured 28 Olympic sports including rugby sevens and golf which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city and at five in São Paulo Belo Horizonte Salvador Brasília and Manaus. These were the first Summer Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Thomas Bach. The host city Rio de Janeiro was announced at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen Denmark on 2 October 2009. Rio became the first South American city to host the Summer Olympics. These were the first games to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country the first to be held entirely in the host countrys winter the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere. The lead-up to these Games was marked by controversies including the instability of the countrys federal government; health and safety concerns surrounding the Zika virus and significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay; and a doping scandal involving Russia which has affected the participation of its athletes in the Games. The United States topped the medal table for the fifth time in the past six Summer Olympics winning the most golds 46 and most medals overall 121. Great Britain finished second and became the first country in the history of the modern Olympics to increase its tally of medals in the subsequent games after being the host nation. China finished third. Host country Brazil won seven gold medals its most at any single Summer Olympics finishing in thirteenth place. Fiji Jordan Kosovo Puerto Rico Singapore Tajikistan Ivory Coast and Vietnam each won their first gold medals as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes from Kuwait. The United States won its 1000th Olympic gold medal in this edition. ,1
560,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1906_Intercalated_Games,The 1906 Intercalated Games or 1906 Olympic Games was an international multi-sport event that was celebrated in Athens Greece. They were at the time considered to be Olympic Games and were referred to as the Second International Olympic Games in Athens by the International Olympic Committee. Whilst medals were distributed to the participants during these games the medals are not officially recognized by the IOC today and are not displayed with the collection of Olympic medals at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne Switzerland. ,1
561,http://dbpedia.org/resource/1964_Winter_Olympics,The 1964 Winter Olympics officially known as the IX Olympic Winter Games French: Les IXes Jeux olympiques dhiver German: Olympische Winterspiele 1964 was a winter multi-sport event which was celebrated in Innsbruck Austria from January 29 to February 9 1964. The Games included 1091 athletes from 36 nations and the Olympic Torch was carried by Joseph Rieder a former alpine skier who had participated in the 1956 Winter Olympics. The Games were affected by the deaths of Australian alpine skier Ross Milne and British luge slider Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski during training and by the deaths three years earlier of the entire US figure skating team and family members. ,1
0,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feedforward_neural_network,A feedforward neural network is an artificial neural network wherein connections between the units do not form a cycle. As such it is different from recurrent neural networks. The feedforward neural network was the first and simplest type of artificial neural network devised. In this network the information moves in only one direction forward from the input nodes through the hidden nodes if any and to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network. ,0
1,http://dbpedia.org/resource/NETtalk_(artificial_neural_network),NETtalk is an artificial neural network. It is the result of research carried out in the mid-1980s by Terrence Sejnowski and Charles Rosenberg. The intent behind NETtalk was to construct simplified models that might shed light on the complexity of learning human level cognitive tasks and their implementation as a connectionist model that could also learn to perform a comparable task. NETtalk is a program that learns to pronounce written English text by being shown text as input and matching phonetic transcriptions for comparison. ,0
2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_delay_neural_network,Time delay neural network TDNN  is an artificial neural network architecture whose primary purpose is to work on sequential data. The TDNN units recognise features independent of time-shift i.e. sequence position and usually form part of a larger pattern recognition system. An example would be converting continuous audio into a stream of classified phoneme labels for speech recognition. An input signal is augmented with delayed copies as other inputs the neural network is time-shift invariant since it has no internal state. The original paper presented a perceptron network whose connection weights were trained with the back-propagation algorithm this may be done in batch or online. The Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator implements that version. ,0
3,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leabra,Leabra stands for Local Error-driven and Associative Biologically Realistic Algorithm. It is a model of learning which is a balance between Hebbian and error-driven learning with other network-derived characteristics. This model is used to mathematically predict outcomes based on inputs and previous learning influences. This model is heavily influenced by and contributes to neural network designs and models.This algorithm is the default algorithm in emergent successor of PDP++ when making a new project and is extensively used in various simulations. Hebbian learning is performed using conditional principal components analysis CPCA algorithm with correction factor for sparse expected activity levels. Error-driven learning is performed using GeneRec which is a generalization of the recirculation algorithm and approximates Almeida–Pineda recurrent backpropagation. The symmetric midpoint version of GeneRec is used which is equivalent to the contrastive Hebbian learning algorithm CHL. See O\Reilly 1996; Neural Computation for more details. The activation function is a point-neuron approximation with both discrete spiking and continuous rate-code output. Layer or unit-group level inhibition can be computed directly using a k-winners-take-all KWTA function producing sparse distributed representations. The net input is computed as an average not a sum over connections based on normalized sigmoidally transformed weight values which are subject to scaling on a connection-group level to alter relative contributions. Automatic scaling is performed to compensate for differences in expected activity level in the different projections. Documentation about this algorithm can be found in the book Computational Explorations in Cognitive Neuroscience: Understanding the Mind by Simulating the Brain published by MIT press. and in the Emergent Documentation ,0
4,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evolutionary_acquisition_of_neural_topologies,Evolutionary acquisition of neural topologies EANT/EANT2 is an evolutionary reinforcement learning method that evolves both the topology and weights of artificial neural networks. It is closely related to the works of Angeline et al. and Stanley and Miikkulainen. Like the work of Angeline et al. the method uses a type of parametric mutation that comes from evolution strategies and evolutionary programming now using the most advanced form of the evolution strategies CMA-ES in EANT2 in which adaptive step sizes are used for optimizing the weights of the neural networks. Similar to the work of Stanley NEAT the method starts with minimal structures which gain complexity along the evolution path. ,0
5,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perceptron,In machine learning the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers functions that can decide whether an input represented by a vector of numbers belongs to some specific class or not. It is a type of linear classifier i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The algorithm allows for online learning in that it processes elements in the training set one at a time. The perceptron algorithm dates back to the late 1950s; its first implementation in custom hardware was one of the first artificial neural networks to be produced. ,0
6,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Autoassociative_memory,Autoassociative memory also known as auto-association memory or an autoassociation network is a generic term that refers to all types of memories that enable one to retrieve a piece of data from only a tiny sample of itself. It is often misunderstood to be only a form of backpropagation or other neural networks. ,0
7,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bidirectional_associative_memory,Bidirectional associative memory BAM is a type of recurrent neural network. BAM was introduced by Bart Kosko in 1988. There are two types of associative memory auto-associative and hetero-associative. BAM is hetero-associative meaning given a pattern it can return another pattern which is potentially of a different size. It is similar to the Hopfield network in that they are both forms of associative memory. However Hopfield nets return patterns of the same size. ,0
8,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Self-organizing_map,A self-organizing map SOM or self-organising feature map SOFM is a type of artificial neural network ANN that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional typically two-dimensional discretized representation of the input space of the training samples called a map. Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space. This makes SOMs useful for visualizing low-dimensional views of high-dimensional data akin to multidimensional scaling. The artificial neural network introduced by the Finnish professor Teuvo Kohonen in the 1980s is sometimes called a Kohonen map or network. The Kohonen net is a computationally convenient abstraction building on work on biologically neural models from the 1970s and morphogenesis models dating back to Alan Turing in the 1950s. Like most artificial neural networks SOMs operate in two modes: training and mapping. Training builds the map using input examples a competitive process also called vector quantization while mapping automatically classifies a new input vector. A self-organizing map consists of components called nodes or neurons. Associated with each node are a weight vector of the same dimension as the input data vectors and a position in the map space. The usual arrangement of nodes is a two-dimensional regular spacing in a hexagonal or rectangular grid. The self-organizing map describes a mapping from a higher-dimensional input space to a lower-dimensional map space. The procedure for placing a vector from data space onto the map is to find the node with the closest smallest distance metric weight vector to the data space vector. While it is typical to consider this type of network structure as related to feedforward networks where the nodes are visualized as being attached this type of architecture is fundamentally different in arrangement and motivation. Useful extensions include using toroidal grids where opposite edges are connected and using large numbers of nodes. It has been shown that while self-organizing maps with a small number of nodes behave in a way that is similar to K-means larger self-organizing maps rearrange data in a way that is fundamentally topological in character. It is also common to use the U-Matrix. The U-Matrix value of a particular node is the average distance between the node\s weight vector and that of its closest neighbors. In a square grid for instance we might consider the closest 4 or 8 nodes the Von Neumann and Moore neighborhoods respectively or six nodes in a hexagonal grid. Large SOMs display  emergent properties. In maps consisting of thousands of nodes it is possible to perform cluster operations on the map itself. ,0
9,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cerebellar_model_articulation_controller,The cerebellar model arithmetic computer CMAC is a type of neural network based on a model of the mammalian cerebellum. It is also known as the cerebellar model articulation controller. It is a type of associative memory. The CMAC was first proposed as a function modeler for robotic controllers by James Albus in 1975 hence the name but has been extensively used in reinforcement learning and also as for automated classification in the machine learning community. CMAC computes a function  where is the number of input dimensions. The input space is divided up into hyper-rectangles each of which is associated with a memory cell. The contents of the memory cells are the weights which are adjusted during training. Usually more than one quantisation of input space is used so that any point in input space is associated with a number of hyper-rectangles and therefore with a number of memory cells. The output of a CMAC is the algebraic sum of the weights in all the memory cells activated by the input point. A change of value of the input point results in a change in the set of activated hyper-rectangles and therefore a change in the set of memory cells participating in the CMAC output. The CMAC output is therefore stored in a distributed fashion such that the output corresponding to any point in input space is derived from the value stored in a number of memory cells hence the name associative memory. This provides generalisation. ,0
10,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neocognitron,The neocognitron is a hierarchical multilayered artificial neural network proposed by Kunihiko Fukushima in the 1980s. It has been used for handwritten character recognition and other pattern recognition tasks and served as the inspiration for convolutional neural networks. The neocognitron was inspired by the model proposed by Hubel & Wiesel in 1959. They found two types of cells in the visual primary cortex called simple cell and complex cell and also proposed a cascading model of these two types of cells. The neocognitron is a natural extension of these cascading models. The neocognitron consists of multiple types of cells the most important of which are called S-cells and C-cells. The local features are extracted by S-cells and these features deformation such as local shifts are tolerated by C-cells. Local features in the input are integrated gradually and classified in the higher layers. The idea of local feature integration is in several other models such as LeNet and SIFT model. There are multiple kinds of neocognitron. For example some types of neocognitron can detect multiple patterns in the same input by using backward signals to achieve selective attention. ,0
11,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rprop,Rprop short for resilient backpropagation is a learning heuristic for supervised learning in feedforward artificial neural networks. This is a first-order optimization algorithm. This algorithm was created by Martin Riedmiller and Heinrich Braun in 1992. Similarly to the Manhattan update rule Rprop takes into account only the sign of the partial derivative over all patterns not the magnitude and acts independently on each weight. For each weight if there was a sign change of the partial derivative of the total error function compared to the last iteration the update value for that weight is multiplied by a factor η− where η− < 1. If the last iteration produced the same sign the update value is multiplied by a factor of η+ where η+ > 1. The update values are calculated for each weight in the above manner and finally each weight is changed by its own update value in the opposite direction of that weight\s partial derivative so as to minimise the total error function. η+ is empirically set to 1.2 and η− to 0.5. Next to the cascade correlation algorithm and the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm Rprop is one of the fastest weight update mechanisms. RPROP is a batch update algorithm. ,0
12,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neural_backpropagation,Neural backpropagation is the phenomenon in which the action potential of a neuron creates a voltage spike both at the end of the axon normal propagation and back through to the dendritic arbor or dendrites from which much of the original input current originated. It has been shown that this simple process can be used in a manner similar to the backpropagation algorithm used in multilayer perceptrons a type of artificial neural network. In addition to active backpropagation of the action potential there is also passive electrotonic spread. While there is ample evidence to prove the existence of backpropagating action potentials the function of such action potentials and the extent to which they invade the most distal dendrites remains highly controversial. ,0
13,http://dbpedia.org/resource/U-matrix,The U-matrix unified distance matrix is a representation of a self-organizing map SOM where the Euclidean distance between the codebook vectors of neighboring neurons is depicted in a grayscale image. This image is used to visualize the data in a high-dimensional space using a 2D image. ,0
14,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Growing_self-organizing_map,A growing self-organizing map GSOM is a growing variant of the popular self-organizing map SOM. The GSOM was developed to address the issue of identifying a suitable map size in the SOM. It starts with a minimal number of nodes usually 4 and grows new nodes on the boundary based on a heuristic. By using the value called Spread Factor SF the data analyst has the ability to control the growth of the GSOM. All the starting nodes of the GSOM are boundary nodes i.e. each node has the freedom to grow in its own direction at the beginning. Fig. 1 New Nodes are grown from the boundary nodes. Once a node is selected for growing all its free neighboring positions will be grown new nodes. The figure shows the three possible node growth options for a rectangular GSOM. ,0
15,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artificial_neural_network,Neural Networks also referred to as connectionist systems are a computational approach which is based on a large collection of neural units loosely modeling the way the brain solves problems with large clusters of biological neurons connected by axons. Each neural unit is connected with many others and links can be enforcing or inhibitory in their effect on the activation state of connected neural units. Each individual neural unit may have a summation function which combines the values of all its inputs together. There may be a threshold function or limiting function on each connection and on the unit itself such that it must surpass it before it can propagate to other neurons. These systems are self-learning and trained rather than explicitly programmed and excel in areas where the solution or feature detection is difficult to express in a traditional computer program. Neural networks typically consist of multiple layers or a cube design and the signal path traverses from front to back. Back propagation is where the forward stimulation is used to reset weights on the front neural units and this is sometimes done in combination with training where the correct result is known. More modern networks are a bit more free flowing in terms of stimulation and inhibition with connections interacting in a much more chaotic and complex fashion. Dynamic neural networks are the most advanced in that they dynamically can based on rules form new connections and even new neural units while disabling others. The goal of the neural network is to solve problems in the same way that the human brain would although several neural networks are much more abstract. Modern neural network projects typically work with a few thousand to a few million neural units and millions of connections which is still several orders of magnitude less complex than the human brain and closer to the computing power of a worm. New brain research often stimulates new patterns in neural networks. One new approach is using connections which span much further and link processing layers rather than always being localized to adjacent neurons. Other research being explored with the different types of signal over time that axons propagate which is more complex than simply on or off. Neural networks are based on real numbers with the value of the core and of the axon typically being a representation between 0.0 and 1. An interesting facet of these systems is that they are unpredictable in their success with self learning. After training some become great problem solvers and others don\t perform as well. In order to train them several thousand cycles of interaction typically occur. Like other machine learning methods – systems that learn from data – neural networks have been used to solve a wide variety of tasks like computer vision and speech recognition that are hard to solve using ordinary rule-based programming. Historically the use of neural network models marked a directional shift in the late eighties from high-level symbolic artificial intelligence characterized by expert systems with knowledge embodied in if-then rules to low-level sub-symbolic machine learning characterized by knowledge embodied in the parameters of a dynamical system. ,0
16,http://dbpedia.org/resource/European_Neural_Network_Society,The European Neural Network Society ENNS is an association of scientists engineers students and others seeking to learn about and advance understanding of artificial neural networks. Specific areas of interest in this scientific field include modelling of behavioral and brain processes development of neural algorithms and applying neural modelling concepts to problems relevant in many different domains. Erkki Oja and John G. Taylor are past ENNS presidents and honorary executive board members. Every year since 1991 ENNS organizes the International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks ICANN. The history and the links to past conferences are available at the ENNS web site. This is one of the oldest and best established conferences on the subject with proceedings published in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science see index in DBLP bibliography database. As a non-profit organization ENNS promotes scientific activities at European and at the national levels in cooperation with national organizations that focus on neural networks. Every year many stipends to attend ICANN conference are given. ENNS also sponsors other students and have given awards and prizes at co-sponsored events schools workshops conferences and competitions.

17,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liquid_state_machine,A liquid state machine LSM is a particular kind of spiking neural network. An LSM consists of a large collection of units called nodes or neurons. Each node receives time varying input from external sources the inputs as well as from other nodes. Nodes are randomly connected to each other. The recurrent nature of the connections turns the time varying input into a spatio-temporal pattern of activations in the network nodes. The spatio-temporal patterns of activation are read out by linear discriminant units. The soup of recurrently connected nodes will end up computing a large variety of nonlinear functions on the input. Given a large enough variety of such nonlinear functions it is theoretically possible to obtain linear combinations using the read out units to perform whatever mathematical operation is needed to perform a certain task such as speech recognition or computer vision. The word liquid in the name comes from the analogy drawn to dropping a stone into a still body of water or other liquid. The falling stone will generate ripples in the liquid. The input motion of the falling stone has been converted into a spatio-temporal pattern of liquid displacement ripples. LSMs have been put forward as a way to explain the operation of brains. LSMs are argued to be an improvement over the theory of artificial neural networks because: 1.  \n* Circuits are not hard coded to perform a specific task. 2.  \n* Continuous time inputs are handled naturally. 3.  \n* Computations on various time scales can be done using the same network. 4.  \n* The same network can perform multiple computations. Criticisms of LSMs as used in computational neuroscience are that 1.  \n* LSMs don\t actually explain how the brain functions. At best they can replicate some parts of brain functionality. 2.  \n* There is no guaranteed way to dissect a working network and figure out how or what computations are being performed. 3.  \n* Very little control over the process. ,0
18,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cellular_neural_network,In computer science and machine learning cellular neural networks CNN or cellular nonlinear networks CNN are a parallel computing paradigm similar to neural networks with the difference that communication is allowed between neighbouring units only. Typical applications include image processing analyzing 3D surfaces solving partial differential equations reducing non-visual problems to geometric maps modelling biological vision and other sensory-motor organs. ,0
19,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Convolutional_neural_network,In machine learning a convolutional neural network CNN or ConvNet is a type of feed-forward artificial neural network in which the connectivity pattern between its neurons is inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex. Individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli in a restricted region of space known as the receptive field. The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they tile the visual field. The response of an individual neuron to stimuli within its receptive field can be approximated mathematically by a convolution operation. Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes and are variations of multilayer perceptrons designed to use minimal amounts of preprocessing. They have wide applications in image and video recognition recommender systems and natural language processing. The convolutional neural network is also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural network SIANN which is named based on its shared weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics. ,0
20,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oja's_rule,Ojas learning rule or simply Ojas rule named after Finnish computer scientist Erkki Oja is a model of how neurons in the brain or in artificial neural networks change connection strength or learn over time. It is a modification of the standard Hebbs Rule see Hebbian learning that through multiplicative normalization solves all stability problems and generates an algorithm for principal components analysis. This is a computational form of an effect which is believed to happen in biological neurons. ,0
21,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Probabilistic_neural_network,A probabilistic neural network PNN is a feedforward neural network which was derived from the Bayesian network and a statistical algorithm called Kernel Fisher discriminant analysis. It was introduced by D.F. Specht in the early 1990s. In a PNN the operations are organized into a multilayered feedforward network with four layers: \n*  Input layer \n*  Hidden layer \n*  Pattern layer/Summation layer \n*  Output layer ,0
22,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Recurrent_neural_network,A recurrent neural network RNN is a class of artificial neural network where connections between units form a directed cycle. This creates an internal state of the network which allows it to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks RNNs can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented connected handwriting recognition or speech recognition. ,0
23,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feed_forward_(control),Feed-forward sometimes written feedforward is a term describing an element or pathway within a control system which passes a controlling signal from a source in its external environment often a command signal from an external operator to a load elsewhere in its external environment. A control system which has only feed-forward behavior responds to its control signal in a pre-defined way without responding to how the load reacts; it is in contrast with a system that also has feedback which adjusts the output to take account of how it affects the load and how the load itself may vary unpredictably; the load is considered to belong to the external environment of the system. In a feed-forward system the control variable adjustment is not error-based. Instead it is based on knowledge about the process in the form of a mathematical model of the process and knowledge about or measurements of the process disturbances. Some prerequisites are needed for control scheme to be reliable by pure feed-forward without feedback: the external command or controlling signal must be available and the effect of the output of the system on the load should be known that usually means that the load must be predictably unchanging with time. Sometimes pure feed-forward control without feedback is called ballistic because once a control signal has been sent it cannot be further adjusted; any corrective adjustment must be by way of a new control signal. In contrast cruise control adjusts the output in response to the load that it encounters by a feedback mechanism. These systems could relate to control theory physiology or computing. ,0
24,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Backpropagation,Backpropagation an abbreviation for backward propagation of errors is a common method of training artificial neural networks used in conjunction with an optimization method such as gradient descent. The method calculates the gradient of a loss function with respect to all the weights in the network so that the gradient is fed to the optimization method which in turn uses it to update the weights in an attempt to minimize the loss function. Backpropagation requires a known desired output for each input value in order to calculate the loss function gradient. It is therefore usually considered to be a supervised learning method although it is also used in some unsupervised networks such as autoencoders. It is a generalization of the delta rule to multi-layered feedforward networks made possible by using the chain rule to iteratively compute gradients for each layer. Backpropagation requires that the activation function used by the artificial neurons or nodes be differentiable. ,0
25,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nervous_system_network_models,Network of human nervous system comprises nodes for example neurons that are connected by links for example synapses. The connectivity may be viewed anatomically functionally or electrophysiologically. These are presented in several Wikipedia articles that include Connectionism a.k.a. Parallel Distributed Processing PDP Biological neural network Artificial neural network a.k.a. Neural network Computational neuroscience as well as in several books by Ascoli G. A. 2002 Sterratt D. Graham B. Gillies A. & Willshaw D. 2011 Gerstner W. & Kistler W. 2002 and Rumelhart J. L. McClelland J. L. and PDP Research Group 1986 among others. The focus of this article is a comprehensive view of modeling a neural network technically neuronal network based on neuron model. Once an approach based on the perspective and connectivity is chosen the models are developed at microscopic ion and neuron mesoscopic functional or population or macroscopic system levels. Computational modeling refers to models that are developed using computing tools. ,0
26,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Generalized_Hebbian_Algorithm,The Generalized Hebbian Algorithm GHA also known in the literature as Sangers rule is a linear feedforward neural network model for unsupervised learning with applications primarily in principal components analysis. First defined in 1989 it is similar to Ojas rule in its formulation and stability except it can be applied to networks with multiple outputs. The name originates because of the similarity between the algorithm and a hypothesis made by Donald Hebb about the way in which synaptic strengths in the brain are modified in response to experience i.e. that changes are proportional to the correlation between the firing of pre- and post-synaptic neurons. ,0
27,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Generative_topographic_map,Generative topographic map GTM is a machine learning method that is a probabilistic counterpart of the self-organizing map SOM is probably convergent and does not require a shrinking neighborhood or a decreasing step size. It is a generative model: the data is assumed to arise by first probabilistically picking a point in a low-dimensional space mapping the point to the observed high-dimensional input space via a smooth function then adding noise in that space. The parameters of the low-dimensional probability distribution the smooth map and the noise are all learned from the training data using the expectation-maximization EM algorithm. GTM was introduced in 1996 in a paper by Christopher Bishop Markus Svensen and Christopher K. I. Williams. ,0
28,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Computational_cybernetics,Computational cybernetics is the integration of cybernetics and computational intelligence techniques. Though the term Cybernetics entered the technical lexicon in the 1940s and 1950sit was first used informally as a popular noun in the 1960s when it became associated with computers robotics Artificial Intelligence and Science fiction. While Cybernetics is primarily concerned with the study of control systems computational cybernetics focuses on their automatic complex autonomic flexible adaptive operation. Furthermore computational cybernetics covers not only mechanical but biological living social and economical systems. To achieve this goal it uses research from the fields of communication theory signal processing information technology control theory the theory of adaptive systems the theory of complex systems game theory and operational research. ,0
29,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quantum_neural_network,Quantum neural networks QNNs are neural network models which are based on the principles of quantum mechanics. There are two different approaches to QNN research one exploiting quantum information processing to improve existing neural network models sometimes also vice versa and the other one searching for potential quantum effects in the brain. ,0
30,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Multilayer_perceptron,A multilayer perceptron MLP is a feedforward artificial neural network model that maps sets of input data onto a set of appropriate outputs. An MLP consists of multiple layers of nodes in a directed graph with each layer fully connected to the next one. Except for the input nodes each node is a neuron or processing element with a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training the network.

31,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hybrid_neural_network,The term hybrid neural network can have two meanings: 1.  \n* biological neural networks interacting with artificial neuronal models and 2.  \n* Artificial neural networks with a symbolic part or conversely symbolic computations with a connectionist part. As for the first meaning the artificial neurons and synapses in hybrid networks can be digital or analog. For the digital variant voltage clamps are used to monitor the membrane potential of neurons to computationally simulate artificial neurons and synapses and to stimulate biological neurons by inducing synaptic. For the analog variant specially designed electronic circuits connect to a network of living neurons through electrodes. As for the second meaning incorporating elements of symbolic computation and artificial neural networks into one model was an attempt to combine the advantages of both paradigms while avoid the shortcomings. Symbolic representations have advantages with respect to explicit direct control fast initial coding dynamic variable binding and knowledge abstraction. Representations of artificial neural networks on the other hand show advantages for biological plausibility learning robustness fault-tolerant processing and graceful decay and generalization to similar input. Since the early 1990s many attempts have been made to reconcile the two approaches. ,0
32,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radial_basis_function_network,In the field of mathematical modeling a radial basis function network is an artificial neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions. The output of the network is a linear combination of radial basis functions of the inputs and neuron parameters. Radial basis function networks have many uses including function approximation time series prediction classification and system control. They were first formulated in a 1988 paper by Broomhead and Lowe both researchers at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment. ,0

34,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deep_learning,Deep learning also known as deep structured learning hierarchical learning or deep machine learning is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high level abstractions in data by using a deep graph with multiple processing layers composed of multiple linear and non-linear transformations. Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning representations of data. An observation e.g. an image can be represented in many ways such as a vector of intensity values per pixel or in a more abstract way as a set of edges regions of particular shape etc. Some representations are better than others at simplifying the learning task e.g. face recognition or facial expression recognition. One of the promises of deep learning is replacing handcrafted features with efficient algorithms for unsupervised or semi-supervised feature learning and hierarchical feature extraction. Research in this area attempts to make better representations and create models to learn these representations from large-scale unlabeled data. Some of the representations are inspired by advances in neuroscience and are loosely based on interpretation of information processing and communication patterns in a nervous system such as neural coding which attempts to define a relationship between various stimuli and associated neuronal responses in the brain. Various deep learning architectures such as  convolutional deep neural networks deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks have been applied to fields like computer vision automatic speech recognition natural language processing audio recognition and bioinformatics where they have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various tasks. Deep learning has been characterized as a buzzword or a rebranding of neural networks. ,0
35,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hierarchical_temporal_memory,Hierarchical temporal memory HTM is an unsupervised to semi-supervised online machine learning model developed by Jeff Hawkins and Dileep George of Numenta Inc. that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex. HTM is a biomimetic model based on the memory-prediction theory of brain function described by Jeff Hawkins in his book On Intelligence. HTM is a method for discovering and inferring the high-level causes of observed input patterns and sequences thus building an increasingly complex model of the world. Jeff Hawkins states that HTM does not present any new idea or theory but combines existing ideas to mimic the neocortex with a simple design that provides a large range of capabilities. HTM combines and extends approaches used in Sparse distributed memory Bayesian networks spatial and temporal clustering algorithms while using a tree-shaped hierarchy of nodes that is common in neural networks. ,0

It alters both the weighting parameters and structures of networks attempting to find a balance between the fitness of evolved solutions and their diversity. It is based on applying three key techniques: tracking genes with history markers to allow crossover among topologies applying speciation the evolution of species to preserve innovations and developing topologies incrementally from simple initial structures complexifying. ,0

38,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Universal_approximation_theorem,In the mathematical theory of artificial neural networks the universal approximation theorem states that a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer containing a finite number of neurons i.e. a multilayer perceptron can approximate continuous functions on compact subsets of Rn under mild assumptions on the activation function. The theorem thus states that simple neural networks can represent a wide variety of interesting functions when given appropriate parameters; however it does not touch upon the algorithmic learnability of those parameters. One of the first versions of the theorem was proved by George Cybenko in 1989 for sigmoid activation functions. Kurt Hornik showed in 1991 that it is not the specific choice of the activation function but rather the multilayer feedforward architecture itself which gives neural networks the potential of being universal approximators. The output units are always assumed to be linear. For notational convenience only the single output case will be shown. The general case can easily be deduced from the single output case. ,0

40,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reservoir_computing,Reservoir computing is a framework for computation that may be viewed as an extension of neural networks.Typically an input signal is fed into a fixed random dynamical system called a reservoir and the dynamics of the reservoir map the input to a higher dimension.Then a simple readout mechanism is trained to read the state of the reservoir and map it to the desired output.The main benefit is that the training is performed only at the readout stage and the reservoir is fixed.Liquid-state machines and echo state networksare two major types of reservoir computing. ,0
41,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radial_basis_function,A radial basis function RBF is a real-valued function whose value depends only on the distance from the origin so that ; or alternatively on the distance from some other point c called a center so that . Any function that satisfies the property is a radial function. The norm is usually Euclidean distance although other distance functions are also possible. Sums of radial basis functions are typically used to approximate given functions. This approximation process can also be interpreted as a simple kind of neural network; this was the context in which they originally surfaced in work by David Broomhead and David Lowe in 1988 which stemmed from Michael J. D. Powells seminal research from 1977.RBFs are also used as a kernel in support vector classification. ,0
42,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sigmoid_function,A sigmoid function is a mathematical function having an S shaped curve sigmoid curve. Often sigmoid function refers to the special case of the logistic function shown in the first figure and defined by the formula Other examples of similar shapes include the Gompertz curve used in modeling systems that saturate at large values of t and the ogee curve used in the spillway of some dams. Sigmoid functions have finite limits at negative infinity and infinity most often going either from 0 to 1 or from −1 to 1 depending on convention. A wide variety of sigmoid functions have been used as the activation function of artificial neurons including the logistic and hyperbolic tangent functions. Sigmoid curves are also common in statistics as cumulative distribution functions which go from 0 to 1 such as the integrals of the logistic distribution the normal distribution and Student\s t probability density functions. ,0

44,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quickprop,Quickprop is an iterative method for determining the minimum of the loss function of an artificial neural network following an algorithm inspired by the Newtons method. Sometimes the algorithm is classified to the group of the second order learning methods. It follows a quadratic approximation of the previous gradient step and the current gradient which is expected to be closed to the minimum of the loss function under the assumption that the loss function is locally approximately square trying to describe it by means of an upwardly open parabola. The minimum is sought in the vertex of the parabola. The procedure requires only local information of the artificial neuron to which it is applied.The k-th approximation step is given by: Being the neuron j weight of its i input and E is the loss function. The Quickprop algorithm is an implementation of the error backpropagation algorithm but the network can behave chaotically during the learning phase due to large step sizes. ,0

47,http://dbpedia.org/resource/ADALINE,ADALINE Adaptive Linear Neuron or later Adaptive Linear Element is an early single-layer artificial neural network and the name of the physical device that implemented this network. The network uses memistors. It was developed by Professor Bernard Widrow and his graduate student Ted Hoff at Stanford University in 1960. It is based on the McCulloch–Pitts neuron. It consists of a weight a bias and a summation function. The difference between Adaline and the standard McCulloch–Pitts perceptron is that in the learning phase the weights are adjusted according to the weighted sum of the inputs the net. In the standard perceptron the net is passed to the activation transfer function and the functions output is used for adjusting the weights. There also exists an extension known as Madaline. ,0
48,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adaptive_resonance_theory,Adaptive resonance theory ART is a theory developed by Stephen Grossberg and Gail Carpenter on aspects of how the brain processes information. It describes a number of neural network models which use supervised and unsupervised learning methods and address problems such as pattern recognition and prediction. The primary intuition behind the ART model is that object identification and recognition generally occur as a result of the interaction of top-down observer expectations with bottom-up sensory information. The model postulates that top-down expectations take the form of a memory template or prototype that is then compared with the actual features of an object as detected by the senses. This comparison gives rise to a measure of category belongingness. As long as this difference between sensation and expectation does not exceed a set threshold called the vigilance parameter the sensed object will be considered a member of the expected class. The system thus offers a solution to the plasticity/stability problem i.e. the problem of acquiring new knowledge without disrupting existing knowledge. ,0
49,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Echo_state_network,The echo state network ESN is a recurrent neural network with a sparsely connected hidden layer with typically 1% connectivity. The connectivity and weights of hidden neurons are fixed and randomly assigned. The weights of output neurons can be learned so that the network can reproduce specific temporal patterns. The main interest of this network is that although its behaviour is non-linear the only parameters are the weights of the output layer. Thus the error function is quadratic with respect to the parameter vector and can be differentiated easily to a linear system. ,0
50,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spiking_neural_network,Spiking neural networks SNNs fall into the third generation of neural network models increasing the level of realism in a neural simulation. In addition to neuronal and synaptic state SNNs also incorporate the concept of time into their operating model. The idea is that neurons in the SNN do not fire at each propagation cycle as it happens with typical multi-layer perceptron networks but rather fire only when a membrane potential – an intrinsic quality of the neuron related to its membrane electrical charge – reaches a specific value. When a neuron fires it generates a signal which travels to other neurons which in turn increase or decrease their potentials in accordance with this signal. In the context of spiking neural networks the current activation level modeled as some differential equation is normally considered to be the neurons state with incoming spikes pushing this value higher and then either firing or decaying over time. Various coding methods exist for interpreting the outgoing spike train as a real-value number either relying on the frequency of spikes or the timing between spikes to encode information. ,0
51,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delta_rule,In machine learning the delta rule is a gradient descent learning rule for updating the weights of the inputs to artificial neurons in a single-layer neural network. It is a special case of the more general backpropagation algorithm. For a neuron with activation function  the delta rule for s th weight is given by  where It holds that and . The delta rule is commonly stated in simplified form for a neuron with a linear activation function as While the delta rule is similar to the perceptrons update rule the derivation is different. The perceptron uses the Heaviside step function as the activation function  and that means that does not exist at zero and is equal to zero elsewhere which makes the direct application of the delta rule impossible. ,0
52,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helmholtz_machine,The Helmholtz machine is a type of artificial neural network that can account for the hidden structure of a set of data by being trained to create a generative model of the original set of data. The hope is that by learning economical representations of the data the underlying structure of the generative model should reasonably approximate the hidden structure of the data set. A Helmholtz machine contains two networks a bottom-up recognition network that takes the data as input and produces a distribution over hidden variables and a top-down generative network that generates values of the hidden variables and the data itself. Helmholtz machines are usually trained using an unsupervised learning algorithm such as the wake-sleep algorithm. Helmholtz machines may also be used in applications requiring a supervised learning algorithm e.g. character recognition or position-invariant recognition of an object within a field. ,0
53,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stochastic_neural_network,Stochastic neural networks are a type of artificial neural networks built by introducing random variations into the network either by giving the networks neurons stochastic transfer functions or by giving them stochastic weights. This makes them useful tools for optimization problems since the random fluctuations help it escape from local minima. An example of a neural network using stochastic transfer functions is a Boltzmann machine. Each neuron is binary valued and the chance of it firing depends on the other neurons in the network. Stochastic neural networks have found applications in risk management oncology bioinformatics and other similar fields. ,0
54,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Autoencoder,An autoencoder autoassociator or Diabolo network is an artificial neural network used for unsupervised learning of efficient codings.The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation encoding for a set of data typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction. Recently the autoencoder concept has become more widely used for learning generative models of data. ,0
55,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adaptive_neuro_fuzzy_inference_system,An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system or adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system ANFIS is a kind of artificial neural network that is based on Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy inference system. The technique was developed in the early 1990s. Since it integrates both neural networks and fuzzy logic principles it has potential to capture the benefits of both in a single framework. Its inference system corresponds to a set of fuzzy IF–THEN rules that have learning capability to approximate nonlinear functions. Hence ANFIS is considered to be a universal estimator. For using the ANFIS in a more efficient and optimal way one can use the best parameters obtained by genetic algorithm. ,0
56,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Group_method_of_data_handling,Group method of data handling GMDH is a family of inductive algorithms for computer-based mathematical modeling of multi-parametric datasets that features fully automatic structural and parametric optimization of models. GMDH is used in such fields as data mining knowledge discovery prediction complex systems modeling optimization and pattern recognition. GMDH algorithms are characterized by inductive procedure that performs sorting-out of gradually complicated polynomial models and selecting the best solution by means of the so-called external criterion. A GMDH model with multiple inputs and one output is a subset of components of the base function 1: where f are elementary functions dependent on different sets of inputs a are coefficients and m is the number of the base function components. In order to find the best solution GMDH algorithms consider various component subsets of the base function 1 called partial models. Coefficients of these models are estimated by the least squares method. GMDH algorithms gradually increase the number of partial model components and find a model structure with optimal complexity indicated by the minimum value of an external criterion. This process is called self-organization of models. The most popular base function used in GMDH is the gradually complicated Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomial 2: The resulting models are also known as polynomial neural networks. Jürgen Schmidhuber cites GDMH as one of the earliest deep learning methods remarking that it was used to train eight-layer neural nets as early as 1971. ,0
57,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Compositional_pattern-producing_network,Compositional pattern-producing networks CPPNs are a variation of artificial neural networks ANNs that differ in their set of activation functions and how they are applied. While ANNs often contain only sigmoid functions and sometimes Gaussian functions CPPNs can include both types of functions and many others. The choice of functions for the canonical set can be biased toward specific types of patterns and regularities. For example periodic functions such as sine produce segmented patterns with repetitions while symmetric functions such as Gaussian produce symmetric patterns. Linear functions can be employed to produce linear or fractal-like patterns. Thus the architect of a CPPN-based genetic art system can bias the types of patterns it generates by deciding the set of canonical functions to include. Furthermore unlike typical ANNs CPPNs are applied across the entire space of possible inputs so that they can represent a complete image. Since they are compositions of functions CPPNs in effect encode images at infinite resolution and can be sampled for a particular display at whatever resolution is optimal. CPPNs can be evolved through neuroevolution techniques such as neuroevolution of augmenting topologies called CPPN-NEAT. CPPNs have been shown to be a very powerful encoding when evolving the following: \n*  Neural networks via the HyperNEAT algorithm \n*  2D images on PicBreeder.org \n*  3D objects on EndlessForms.com \n*  Robot morphologies Rigid Robots Soft Robots. ,0
58,http://dbpedia.org/resource/CoDi,CoDi is a cellular automaton CA model for spiking neural networks SNNs. CoDi is an acronym for Collect and Distribute referring to the signals and spikes in a neural network. CoDi uses a von Neumann neighborhood modified for a three-dimensional space; each cell looks at the states of its six orthogonal neighbors and its own state. In a growth phase a neural network is grown in the CA-space based on an underlying chromosome. There are four types of cells: neuron body axon dendrite and blank. The growth phase is followed by a signaling- or processing-phase. Signals are distributed from the neuron bodies via their axon tree and collected from connection dendrites. These two basic interactions cover every case and they can be expressed simply using a small number of rules. ,0
59,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Learning_rule,Learning rule or Learning process is a method or a mathematical logic which improves the artificial neural networks performance and usually this rule is applied repeatedly over the network. It is done by updating the weights and bias levels of a network when a network is simulated in a specific data environment. A learning rule may accept existing condition  weights and bias  of the network and will compare the expected result and actual result of the network to give new and improved values for weights and bias.  Depending on the complexity of actual model which is being simulated the learning rule of the network can be as simple as an XOR gate or Mean Squared Error or it can be the result of multiple differential equations. The learning rule is one of the factors which decides how fast or how accurate the artificial network can be developed. Depending upon the process to develop the network there are three main models of machine learning: 1.  \n*  Unsupervised learning 2.  \n*  Supervised learning 3.  \n*  Reinforcement learning ,0

The current aim of the Animat research is to study the neuronal activity and plasticity when learning and processing information in order to find a mathematical model for the neural network.

61,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Optical_neural_network,An optical neural network is a physical implementation of an artificial neural network with optical components. Some artificial neural networks that have been implemented as optical neural networks include the Hopfield neural network and the Kohonen self-organizing map with liquid crystals . Biological neural networks function on an electrochemical basis while optical neural networks use electromagnetic waves. Optical interfaces to biological neural networks can be created with optogenetics but is not the same as an optical neural networks. In biological neural networks there exist a lot of different mechanisms for dynamically changing the state of the neurons these include short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is among the electrophysiological phenomena used to control the efficiency of synaptic transmission long-term for learning and memory and short-term for short transient changes in synaptic transmission efficiency. Implementing this with optical components is difficult and ideally requires advanced photonic materials. Properties that might be desirable in photonic materials for optical neural networks include the ability to change their efficiency of transmitting light based on the intensity of incoming light. There is one recent 2007 model of Optical Neural Network: the Programmable Optical Array/Analogic Computer POAC. It had been implemented in the year 2000 and reported based on modified Joint Fourier Transform Correlator JTC and Bacteriorhodopsin BR as a holographic optical memory. Full parallelism large array size and the speed of light are three promises offered by POAC to implement an optical CNN. They had been investigated during the last years with their practical limitations and considerations yielding the design of the first portable POAC version. The practical details: hardware optical setups and software optical templates are published. However POAC is a general purpose and programmable array computer that has a wide range of applications including: \n*  image processing \n*  pattern recognition \n*  target tracking \n*  real-time video processing \n*  document security \n*  optical switching ,0
62,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Early_stopping,In machine learning early stopping is a form of regularization used to avoid overfitting when training a learner with an iterative method such as gradient descent. Such methods update the learner so as to make it better fit the training data with each iteration. Up to a point this improves the learners performance on data outside of the training set. Past that point however improving the learners fit to the training data comes at the expense of increased generalization error. Early stopping rules provide guidance as to how many iterations can be run before the learner begins to over-fit. Early stopping rules have been employed in many different machine learning methods with varying amounts of theoretical foundation. ,0
63,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artificial_neuron,An artificial neuron is a mathematical function conceived as a model of biological neurons. Artificial neurons are the constitutive units in an artificial neural network. Depending on the specific model used they may be called a semi-linear unit Nv neuron binary neuron linear threshold function or McCulloch–Pitts MCP neuron. The artificial neuron receives one or more inputs representing dendrites and sums them to produce an output representing a neurons axon. Usually the sums of each node are weighted and the sum is passed through a non-linear function known as an activation function or transfer function. The transfer functions usually have a sigmoid shape but they may also take the form of other non-linear functions piecewise linear functions or . They are also often monotonically increasing continuous differentiable and bounded. The thresholding function is inspired to build logic gates referred to as threshold logic; with a renewed interest to build logic circuit resembling brain processing. For example new devices such as memristors have been extensively used to develop such logic in the recent times. The artificial neuron transfer function should not be confused with a linear systems transfer function. ,0
64,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rectifier_(neural_networks),In the context of artificial neural networks the rectifier is an activation function defined as where x is the input to a neuron. This is also known as a ramp function and is analogous to half-wave rectification in electrical engineering. This activation function is first introduced to a dynamical network byHahnloser et al in a 2000 paper in Naturewith strong biological motivations and mathematical justifications.It has been used in convolutional networksthan the widely used logistic sigmoid which is inspired by probability theory; see logistic regression and its more practicalcounterpart the hyperbolic tangent. The rectifier is as of 2015 the most popular activation function for deep neural networks. A unit employing the rectifier is also called a rectified linear unit ReLU. A smooth approximation to the rectifier is the analytic function which is called the softplus function.The derivative of softplus is  i.e. the logistic function. Rectified linear units find applications in computer visionand speech recognition using deep neural nets. ,0
65,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neural_gas,Neural gas is an artificial neural network inspired by the self-organizing map and introduced in 1991 by Thomas Martinetz and Klaus Schulten. The neural gas is a simple algorithm for finding optimal data representations based on feature vectors. The algorithm was coined neural gas because of the dynamics of the feature vectors during the adaptation process which distribute themselves like a gas within the data space. It is applied where data compression or vector quantization is an issue for example speech recognition image processing or pattern recognition. As a robustly converging alternative to the k-means clustering it is also used for cluster analysis. ,0

67,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Activation_function,In computational networks the activation function of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs. A standard computer chip circuit can be seen as a digital network of activation functions that can be ON 1 or OFF 0 depending on input. This is similar to the behavior of the linear perceptron in neural networks. However it is the nonlinear activation function that allows such networks to compute nontrivial problems using only a small number of nodes. In artificial neural networks this function is also called transfer function not to be confused with a linear system’s transfer function. ,0

It evolves variable size feedforward artificial neural networks ANN that are encoded into sequences of genes for constructing a basic ANN unit. Each of these blocks is preceded by a gene promoter acting as an on/off switch that determines if that particular unit will be expressed or not. ,0
69,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pulse-coupled_networks,Pulse-coupled networks or pulse-coupled neural networks PCNNs are neural models proposed by modeling a cat’s visual cortex and developed for high-performance biomimetic image processing. In 1989 Eckhorn introduced a neural model to emulate the mechanism of cat’s visual cortex. The Eckhorn model provided a simple and effective tool for studying small mammal’s visual cortex and was soon recognized as having significant application potential in image processing. In 1994 Johnson adapted the Eckhorn model to an image processing algorithm calling this algorithm a pulse-coupled neural network. Over the past decade PCNNs have been used in a variety of image processing applications including: image segmentation feature generation face extraction motion detection region growing and noise reduction. The basic property of the Eckhorn\s linking-field model LFM is the coupling term. LFM is a modulation of the primary input by a biased offset factor driven by the linking input. These drive a threshold variable that decays from an initial high value. When the threshold drops below zero it is reset to a high value and the process starts over. This is different than the standard integrate-and-fire neural model which accumulates the input until it passes an upper limit and effectively shorts out to cause the pulse. LFM uses this difference to sustain pulse bursts something the standard model does not do on a single neuron level. It is valuable to understand however that a detailed analysis of the standard model must include a shunting term due to the floating voltages level in the dendritic compartments and in turn this causes an elegant multiple modulation effect that enables a true higher-order network HON. Multidimensional pulse image processing of chemical structure data using PCNN has been discussed by Kinser et al. A PCNN is a two-dimensional neural network. Each neuron in the network corresponds to one pixel in an input image receiving its corresponding pixel’s color information e.g. intensity as an external stimulus. Each neuron also connects with its neighboring neurons receiving local stimuli from them. The external and local stimuli are combined in an internal activation system which accumulates the stimuli until it exceeds a dynamic threshold resulting in a pulse output. Through iterative computation PCNN neurons produce temporal series of pulse outputs. The temporal series of pulse outputs contain information of input images and can be used for various image processing applications such as image segmentation and feature generation. Compared with conventional image processing means PCNNs have several significant merits including robustness against noise independence of geometric variations in input patterns capability of bridging minor intensity variations in input patterns etc. A simplified PCNN called a spiking cortical model was developed in 2009. PCNNs are useful for image processing as discussed in a book by Thomas Lindblad and Jason M. Kinser. ,0

71,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Instantaneously_trained_neural_networks,Instantaneously trained neural networks are feedforward artificial neural networks that create a new hidden neuron node for each novel training sample. The weights to this hidden neuron separate out not only this training sample but others that are near it thus providing generalization. This training can be done in a variety of ways and the most popular network in this family is called the CC4 network where the separation is done using the nearest hyperplane that can be written down instantaneously. These networks use unary coding for an effective representation of the data sets. Instantaneously trained neural networks have been proposed as models of short term learning and used in web search and financial time series prediction applications. They have also been used in instant classification of documents and for deep learning and data mining. As in other neural networks their normal use is as software but they have also been implemented in hardware using FPGAs and by optical implementation. ,0
72,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boltzmann_machine,A Boltzmann machine is a type of stochastic recurrent neural network and Markov Random Field invented by Geoffrey Hinton and Terry Sejnowski in 1985. Boltzmann machines can be seen as the stochastic generative counterpart of Hopfield nets. They were one of the first examples of a neural network capable of learning internal representations and are able to represent and given sufficient time solve difficult combinatoric problems. They are theoretically intriguing because of the locality and Hebbian nature of their training algorithm and because of their parallelism and the resemblance of their dynamics to simple physical processes. Due to a number of issues discussed below Boltzmann machines with unconstrained connectivity have not proven useful for practical problems in machine learning or inference but if the connectivity is properly constrained the learning can be made efficient enough to be useful for practical problems They are named after the Boltzmann distribution in statistical mechanics which is used in their sampling function. ,0
73,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hopfield_network,A Hopfield network is a form of recurrent artificial neural network popularized by John Hopfield in 1982 but described earlier by Little in 1974. Hopfield nets serve as content-addressable memory systems with binary threshold nodes. They are guaranteed to converge to a local minimum but will sometimes converge to a false pattern wrong local minimum rather than the stored pattern expected local minimum. Hopfield networks also provide a model for understanding human memory. ,0

There are limitations to a link topology for the von Neumann’s network but SNN accept a case without these limitations. Only logical values can be processed but SNN accept that fuzzy values can be processed too. All neurons into the von Neumann network are synchronized by tacts. For further use of self-synchronizing circuit technique SNN accepts neurons can be self-running or synchronized. In contrast to the von Neumann network there are no limitations for topology of neurons for semantic networks. It leads to the impossibility of relative addressing of neurons as it was done by von Neumann. In this case an absolute readdressing should be used. Every neuron should have a unique identifier that would provide a direct access to another neuron. Of course neurons interacting by axons-dendrites should have each others identifiers. An absolute readdressing can be modulated by using neuron specificity as it was realized for biological neural networks. There’s no description for self-reflectiveness and self-modification abilities into the initial description of semantic networks Dudar Z.V. Shuklin D.E. 2000]. But in Shuklin D.E. 2004] a conclusion had been drawn about the necessity of introspection and self-modification abilities in the system. For maintenance of these abilities a concept of pointer to neuron is provided. Pointers represent virtual connections between neurons. In this model bodies and signals transferring through the neurons connections represent a physical body and virtual connections between neurons are representing an astral body. It is proposed to create models of artificial neuron networks on the basis of virtual machine supporting the opportunity for paranormal effects. SNN is generally used for natural language processing. ,0
75,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Long_short-term_memory,Long short-term memory LSTM is a recurrent neural network RNN architecture an artificial neural network proposed in 1997 by Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber. Like most RNNs an LSTM network is universal in the sense that given enough network units it can compute anything a conventional computer can compute provided it has the proper weight matrix which may be viewed as its program. Unlike traditional RNNs an LSTM network is well-suited to learn from experience to classify process and predict time series when there are very long time lags of unknown size between important events. This is one of the main reasons why LSTM outperforms alternative RNNs and Hidden Markov Models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications. For example LSTM achieved the best known results in unsegmented connected handwriting recognition and in 2009 won the ICDAR handwriting competition. LSTM networks have also been used for automatic speech recognition and were a major component of a network that in 2013 achieved a record 17.7% phoneme error rate on the classic TIMIT natural speech dataset. As of 2016 major technology companies including Google Apple Microsoft and Baidu are using LSTM networks as fundamental components in new products. ,0

The output from the Kohonen layer which is the winning neuron feeds into a hidden layer and finally into an output layer. In other words the Kohonen SOM is the front–end while the hidden and output layer of a multilayer perceptron is the back–end of thehybrid Kohonen SOM.

87,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infomax,Infomax is an optimization principle for artificial neural networks and other information processing systems. It prescribes that a function that maps a set of input values I to a set of output values O should be chosen or learned so as to maximize the average Shannon mutual information between I and O subject to a set of specified constraints and/or noise processes. Infomax algorithms are learning algorithms that perform this optimization process. The principle was described by Linsker in 1988. Infomax in its zero-noise limit is related to the principle of redundancy reduction proposed for biological sensory processing by Horace Barlow in 1961 and applied quantitatively to retinal processing by Atick and Redlich. One of the applications of infomax has been to an independent component analysis algorithm that finds independent signals by maximising entropy. Infomax-based ICA was described by Bell and Sejnowski in 1995. ,0
88,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Madaline,MADALINE Many ADALINE is a three-layer input hidden output fully connected feed-forward artificial neural network architecture for classification that uses ADALINE units in its hidden and output layers i.e. its activation function is the sign function. The three-layer network uses memistors. Three different training algorithms for MADALINE networks which cannot be learned using backpropagation because the sign function is not differentiable have been suggested called Rule I Rule II and Rule III. The first of these dates back to 1962 and cannot adapt the weights of the hidden-output connection. The second training algorithm improved on Rule I and was described in 1988. The third Rule applied to a modified network with sigmoid activations instead of signum; it was later found to be equivalent to backpropagation. The Rule II training algorithm is based on a principle called minimal disturbance. It proceeds by looping over training examples then for each example it: \n*  finds the hidden layer unit ADALINE classifier with the lowest confidence in its prediction \n*  tentatively flips the sign of the unit \n*  accepts or rejects the change based on whether the network\s error is reduced \n*  stops when the error is zero. Additionally when flipping single units\ signs does not drive the error to zero for a particular example the training algorithm starts flipping pairs of units\ signs then triples of units etc. ,0

92,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Types_of_artificial_neural_networks,There are many types of artificial neural networks ANN. Artificial neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks and are used to approximate functions that are generally unknown. Particularly they are inspired by the behaviour of neurons and the electrical signals they convey between input such as from the eyes or nerve endings in the hand processing and output from the brain such as reacting to light touch or heat. The way neurons semantically communicate is an area of ongoing research. Most artificial neural networks bear only some resemblance to their more complex biological counterparts but are very effective at their intended tasks e.g. classification or segmentation. Some ANNs are adaptive systems and are used for example to model populations and environments which constantly change. Neural networks can be hardware- neurons are represented by physical components or software-based computer models and can use a variety of topologies and learning algorithms. ,0
93,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catastrophic_interference,Catastrophic interference also known as catastrophic forgetting is the tendency of an artificial neural network to completely and abruptly forget previously learned information upon learning new information. Neural networks are an important part of the network approach and connectionist approach to cognitive science. These networks use computer simulations to try and model human behaviours such as memory and learning. Catastrophic interference is an important issue to consider when creating connectionist models of memory. It was originally brought to the attention of the scientific community by research from McCloskey and Cohen 1989 and Ractcliff 1990. It is a radical manifestation of the ‘sensitivity-stability’ dilemma  or the ‘stability-plasticity’ dilemma. Specifically these problems refer to the issue of being able to make an artificial neural network that is sensitive to but not disrupted by new information. Lookup tables and connectionist networks lie on the opposite sides of the stability plasticity spectrum. The former remains completely stable in the presence of new information but lacks the ability to generalize i.e. infer general principles from new inputs. On the other hand connectionist networks like the standard backpropagation network are very sensitive to new information and can generalize on new inputs. Backpropagation models can be considered good models of human memory insofar as they mirror the human ability to generalize but these networks often exhibit less stability than human memory. Notably these backpropagation networks are susceptible to catastrophic interference. This is considered an issue when attempting to model human memory because unlike these networks humans typically do not show catastrophic forgetting. Thus the issue of catastrophic interference must be eradicated from these backpropagation models in order to enhance the plausibility as models of human memory. ,0
94,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counterpropagation_network,The counterpropagation network is a hybrid network. It consists of an outstar network and a competitive filter network. It was developed in 1986 by Robert Hecht-Nielsen. It is guaranteed to find the correct weights unlike regular back propagation networks that can become trapped in local minimums during training. The input layer neurode connect to each neurode in the hidden layer. The hidden layer is a Kohonen network which categorizes the pattern that was input. The output layer is an outstar array which reproduces the correct output pattern for the category. Training is done in two stages. The hidden layer is first taught to categorize the patterns and the weights are then fixed for that layer. Then the output layer is trained. Each pattern that will be input needs a unique node in the hidden layer which is often too large to work on real world problems. ,0
95,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cover's_theorem,Covers Theorem is a statement in computational learning theory and is one of the primary theoretical motivations for the use of non-linear kernel methods in machine learning applications. The theorem states that given a set of training data that is not linearly separable one can with high probability transform it into a training set that is linearly separable by projecting it into a higher-dimensional space via some non-linear transformation. The proof is easy. A deterministic mapping may be used. Indeed suppose there are samples. Lift them onto the vertices of the simplex in the dimensional real space. Every partition of the samples into two sets is separable by a linear separator. QED.

97,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deep_lambertian_networks,Deep Lambertian Networks DLN  is a combination of Deep belief network and Lambertian reflectance assumption which deals with the challenges posed by illumination variation in visual perception. Lambertian Reflectance model gives an illumination invariant representation which can be used for recognition. The Lambertian reflectance model is widely used formodeling illumination variations and is a good approximation for diffuse object surfaces. The DLN is a hybrid undirected-directed generative model that combines DBNs with the Lambertian reflectance model. In the DLN the visible layer consists of image pixel intensities v ∈ RNv  where Nv is the number of pixels in the image. For every pixel i there are two latent variables namely the albedo and surface normal. GRBMs are used to model the albedo and surface normals. Combining Deep Belief Nets with the Lambertian reflectance assumption the model can learn good priors over the albedo from 2D images. Illumination variations can be explained by changing only the lighting latent variable. By transferring learned knowledge from similar objects albedo and surface normals estimation from a single image is also possible. Experiments demonstrate that this model is able to generalize as well as improve over standard baselines in one-shot face recognition. The model has been successfully applied in reconstruction of shadows facial images given any set of lighting conditions. The model has also been tested on non-living objects. The method outperforms most other methods and is faster than them. ,0

101,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ecological_collapse,Ecological collapse refers to a situation where an ecosystem suffers a drastic possibly permanent reduction in carrying capacity for all organisms often resulting in mass extinction. Usually an ecological collapse is precipitated by a disastrous event occurring on a short time scale. Ecosystems have the ability to rebound from a disruptive agent. The difference between collapse or a gentle rebound is determined by two factors —- the toxicity of the introduced element and the resiliency of the original ecosystem. Through natural selection the planets species have continuously adapted to change through variation in their biological composition and distribution. Mathematically it can be demonstrated that greater numbers of different biological factors tend to dampen fluctuations in each of the individual factors. Scientists can predict tipping points for ecological collapse. The most frequently used model for predicting food web collapse is called R50 which is a reliable measurement model for food web robustness. ,0

In Tasmania they can be found in the West Savage River National Park South West North East and in patches on the East Coast. On the mainland of Australia cool temperate rainforest have a wide variety of woodland trees Tasmania only has a limited number of woodland and vascular plants such as mosses liverworts lichen and fungi. Because of this the definition of Tasmanian cool temperate rainforest was redefined in the 1980s to allow for communities that did not meet the canopy requirements and clearly separate cool temperate rainforest from mixed forest; The current definition states that cool temperate rainforest are those with trees usually greater than 8m in height and capable of regenerating in the absence of large scale catastrophic events such as fire.

119,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tropical_rainforest_climate,Tropical rainforests have a type of tropical climate in which there is no dry season – all months have an average precipitation value of at least 60 mm. Tropical rainforests have no summer or winter; it is typically hot and wet throughout the year and rainfall is both heavy and frequent. One day in an equatorial climate can be very similar to the next while the change in temperature between day and night may be larger than the average change in temperature along the year. ,0
120,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rainforest_Shmainforest,Rainforest Shmainforest is the 32nd episode of Comedy Central\s animated series South Park. It originally aired on April 7 1999. This episode features Jennifer Aniston providing the voice for Miss Stevens. The episode criticizes the American Movement to Save the Rain Forest and in typical tongue-in-cheek fashion mocks the manner in which the country of Costa Rica is perceived and often portrayed e.g. in domestic entertainment media by Americans. This episode was inspired by Trey Parker\s personal intense distaste towards rainforests which he formed after a visit to Costa Rica. Parker explains on the DVD commentary that at the suggestion of Flea Parker and his girlfriend went to Costa Rica and hated the area and that everything Cartman says about the rainforests during the episode is how he Parker personally feels. The episode is also filled with famous environmentalist clichés such as We must take only photos and leave only footprints It\s more afraid of us than we are of it and We have to respect mother nature and she will respect us. ,0
121,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kilum-Ijim_Forest,The Kilum-Ijim Forest is an area of mountain rainforest in Cameroons North-West Region. It is found on Mount Oku and the nearby Ijim Ridge in the Cameroon mountains with Lake Oku lying in a crater in its center. It is the largest area of Afromontane forest left in West Africa. The area is an important one for biodiversity including the endemic Bannermans turaco and banded wattle-eye. The forest is the focus of a successful community conservation project the Kilum-Ijim Forest Project which works to protect the forest. The project is a collaboration between the Cameroon Ministry of the Environment and BirdLife International and focuses on sustainable use of the forests local management working to benefit both the biodiversity and local development. The programme works so well that the boundaries of the forest as mapped by satellite imagery are expanding and the success of the idea has led to another sister project in Cameroon the Bamenda Highlands Forest Project. The Kilum-Ijim Forest is an area of land which has extreme biodiversity ranging from tropical rainforest to lake Biomes. To keep the rainforest sustainable and available for future use control of areas of the Kilum Forest have been handed over to the locals to preserve and sustain. ,0

125,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canopy_level_of_temperate_rainforest,Temperate rainforests are coniferous or broadleaf forests that occur in the temperate zone and receive high rainfall. For temperate rain forests of North America Alabacks definition1] is widely recognized:2]1. Annual precipitation 200–400 cm2. Mean annual temperature between 4oC and 12oC. 39o and 54o FahrenheitHowever required annual precipitation depends on factors such as distribution of rainfall over the year temperatures over the year and fog presence and definitions in other countries differ considerably. For example Australian definitions are ecological-structural rather than climatic:1. Closed canopy of trees excludes at least 70% of the sky2. Forest is composed mainly of tree species which do not require fire for regeneration but with seedlings able to regenerate under shade and in natural openings3]The latter would for example exclude a part of the temperate rain forests of western North America as Coast Douglas-fir one of its dominant tree species requires stand-destroying disturbance to initiate a new cohort of seedlings.4] The North American definition would in turn exclude a part of temperate rain forests in other countries. ,0
126,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tropical_rainforest_conservation,Right now people are conserving the Tropical Rain Forests by ecotourism and rehabilitation. Ecotourism is giving people tours of the forest and showing them what we are losing by cutting them down. We are helping them even more by rebuilding and restarting forests in certain areas. By speaking with the local people living in and around the rainforest conservationists can learn information that would allow them to best focus their conservation efforts. Another way conservation has become the most economically beneficial option is through carbon credits. Under the Kyoto Protocol countries must reduce their emissions of Carbon Dioxide by 5% below the 1990 levels before 2012. Countries can meet their mandatory cuts in emissions by offsetting some of those emissions some other way. Through conservation or reforestation of the rainforest countries can receive credits. Some worldwide companies have stated publicly that they wont buy products that come from recently cleared areas of the rainforest  beef from the rainforests often come from areas where forests have been destroyed. Its important to conserve the rainforest because many resources for things we use everyday come from the rainforest including rubber for tires and spices such as cinnamon and many other common items. The rainforest also needs to be conserved because the earth needs trees to take in carbon dioxide. About 1/4 of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation ,0
127,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inland_rainforest,The inland rainforest also known as the inland temperate rainforest in the classification system of the WWF is a temperate rainforest in the Central Interior of British Columbia. It is part of the Interior Cedar Hemlock ICH zone of the biogeoclimatic zones system developed by the BC Ministry of Forests in the Rocky Mountain Trench. One of the richest parts of this wet belt lies 110 kilometres 68 mi east of the city of Prince George and nearly a thousand kilometres 600 miles east of the coastal rainforests. The oldest and most diverse parts of the forest are typically found on northeasterly aspect wet toe slopes with Western Red Cedar Thuja plicata trees over 1000 years old and undisturbed forest stands much older than that. Some of these toe-slope benches were cleared in the 1960s to develop the Yellowhead Highway with the added result that most of the remainder became easily accessible to industrial logging and recreation and more recently to research and interpretation. As a consequence there are only a handful of the best sites left undisturbed in 2008. In 1987 a science-based conservation group Save-The-Cedar League was formed. With the establishment of the new University of Northern British Columbia UNBC in Prince George the 1990s further research continued to highlight the significance of the ICH zone east of the city. The arrival of a defoliating insect outbreak the Hemlock Looper Lambdina fiscellaria fiscellaria resulted in increased salvage logging of old cedar stands along the Yellowhead Highway. This was reduced by the province’s chief forester in the early 2000s as the appreciation of non-timber values of the zone began to be realized and as the Mountain Pine Beetle catastrophe spread across the Interior Plateau to the west and large-scale salvage logging moved in that direction. As the Mountain Pine Beetle wave passes attention is returning to the mountain wet zones. Some of this came to a head in 2006 with the development of an old growth forest trail by the nearby small community of Dome Creek in the richest site yet found a place that was also scheduled to be logged. The resulting socio-economic and ecological issues were investigated in a documentary film Block 486. ,0
128,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tropical_rainforests_of_India,Tropical rainforests of India are found in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands the Western Ghats which fringe the Arabian Sea the coastline of peninsular India and the greater Assam region in the north-east. Small remnants of rainforest are found in Odisha state. Semi-evergreen rainforest is more extensive than the evergreen formation partly because evergreen forests tend to degrade to semi-evergreen with human interference. There are substantial differences in both the flora and fauna between the three major rainforest regions. The Western Ghats monsoon forests occur both on the western coastal margins of the ghats and on the eastern side where there is less rainfall. These forests contain several tree species of great commercial significance e.g. Indian rosewood Dalbergia latifolia Malabar Kino Pterocarpus marsupium teak Tectona grandis and Indian laurel Terminalia crenulata but they have now been cleared from many areas. In the rainforests there is an enormous number of tree species; at least 60 percent of the trees of the upper canopy are of species which individually contribute not more than one percent of the total number. Clumps of bamboo occur along streams or in poorly drained hollows throughout the evergreen and semi-evergreen forests of south-west India probably in areas once cleared for transporting agriculture. The tropical vegetation of north-east India which includes the states of Assam Nagaland Manipur Mizoram Tripura and Meghalaya as well as the plain regions of Arunachal Pradesh typically occurs at elevations up to 900 metres 3000 ft. It embraces evergreen and semi-evergreen rainforests moist deciduous monsoon forests riparian forests swamps and grasslands. Evergreen rainforests are found in the Assam Valley the foothills of the eastern Himalayas and the lower parts of the Naga Hills Meghalaya Mizoram and Manipur where the rain fall exceeds 2300 mm 91 in per annum. In the Assam Valley the giant Hollong Dipterocarpus macrocarpus and Shorea assamica occur singly occasionally attaining a girth of up to 7 metres 23 ft and a height of up to 50 metres 160 ft. The monsoon forests are mainly moist sal Shorea robusta forests which occur widely in this region. The Andaman and Nicobar islands have tropical evergreen rainforests and tropical semi-evergreen rainforests as well as tropical monsoon forests. The dominant species of Keruing wood is Dipterocarpus grandiflorus in hilly areas while Dipterocarpus kerrii is dominant on some islands in the southern parts of the archipelago. The monsoon forests of the Andamans are dominated by the Andaman Redwood Pterocarpus dalbergioides and Terminalia spp. Tropical forests in Indias east present a total contrast with the pine and coniferous woodland of the Western Himalayas. The natural cover of India varies with altitude; these evergreen forests are bounded with high alpine meadows nearer to the snowline and temperate forests of short stout trees at lower elevations. In the Himalayan foothills are deciduous trees with shrubs bamboo ferns and grass. Indias northern plains the course of the holy rivers Ganges and Yamuna; the Thar Desert in the west; the Sundarbans the marshy swamplands in the delta of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra in the east; the Deccan Plateau lying in the rain shadow of the hills and the Western Ghats with their dense; luxuriant forests – all provide fascinating variations in habitats. These forests sustain 350 species of mammals 2100 kinds of birds both local and migratory nearly 350 species of reptile and countless insects. The need for conservation of the environment and the forests has exercised the minds of Indian rulers from the earliest of times. In recent times it was the administrators and princely rulers who demarcated and reserved forests as private preserves. Today many of the forested regions form the nucleus of Indias wildlife sanctuaries and parks. Still increasing population hunting and encroachments continues to threaten Indias forest lands. ,0
129,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carboniferous_rainforest_collapse,The Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse CRC was a minor extinction event that occurred around 305 million years ago in the Carboniferous period. It altered the vast coal forests that covered the equatorial region of Euramerica Europe and America. This event may have fragmented the forests into isolated islands which in turn caused dwarfism and shortly after extinction of many plant and animal species. Following the event coal-forming tropical forests continued in large areas of the Earth but their extent and composition were changed. The event occurred at the end of the Moscovian and continued into the early Kasimovian stages of the Pennsylvanian. ,0

138,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Article_(grammar),An article abbreviated to ART is a word prefix or suffix that is used alongside a noun to indicate the type of reference being made by the noun. Articles specify grammatical definiteness of the noun in some languages extending to volume or numerical scope. The articles in the English language are the and a/an and in certain contexts some. An and a are modern forms of the Old English an which in Anglian dialects was the number one compare on in Saxon dialects and survived into Modern Scots as the number owan. Both on respelled one by the Normans and an survived into Modern English with one used as the number and an a before nouns that begin with a consonant sound as an indefinite article. In many languages articles are a special part of speech which cannot easily be combined with other parts of speech. In English articles are frequently considered a part of a broader speech category called determiners which combines articles and demonstratives such as this and that. In languages that employ articles every common noun with some exceptions is expressed with a certain definiteness e.g. definite or indefinite just as many languages express every noun with a certain grammatical number e.g. singular or plural. Every noun must be accompanied by the article if any corresponding to its definiteness and the lack of an article considered a zero article itself specifies a certain definiteness. This is in contrast to other adjectives and determiners which are typically optional. This obligatory nature of articles makes them among the most common words in many languages—in English for example the most frequent word is the. Articles are usually characterized as either definite or indefinite. A few languages with well-developed systems of articles may distinguish additional subtypes. Within each type languages may have various forms of each article according to grammatical attributes such as gender number or case or according to adjacent sounds. ,0

It encompasses both research regarding the pathophysiology along with clinical methods used to diagnose diseases involving both central and peripheral nervous systems. Examinations in the clinical neurophysiology field are not limited to tests conducted in a laboratory. It is thought of as an extension of a neurologic consultation. Tests that are conducted are concerned with measuring the electrical functions of the brain spinal cord and nerves in the limbs and muscles. It can give the precise definition of site the type and degree of the lesion along with revealing the abnormalities that are in question. Due to these abilities clinical neurophysiology is used to mainly help diagnose diseases rather than treat them. In some countries it is a part of neurology or psychiatry for example the United States and Germany. In other countries it is an autonomous specialty such as Spain Portugal Italy the United Kingdom Finland Sweden and Norway. Hospitals that have neurologists and neurosurgeons tend to house clinical neurophysiology departments. Usually these tend to be larger hospitals that are able to employ more specialized staff units. In hospitals that possess clinical neurophysiology facilities the major diagnostic modalities employed include: \n*  Electromyography and nerve conduction studies: These diagnostic tests of the peripheral nervous system especially useful in evaluating diseases of the muscles nerves and nerve roots. Records electrical activity of the muscles and the passage of them along nerves in the limbs. Most nerve-muscle disorders that occur fall into one of two types of categories morphologic or physiologic which can be seen within the motor unit.

157,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Embarazada,Embarazada Spanish pronunciation: embaɾaˈθaða] is the Spanish word for pregnant. It is a false friend for native English-speaking students of Spanish who may attempt to say I\m embarrassed by saying estoy embarazada. This phrase actually means I\m pregnant in Spanish. This may be confusing to Spanish speakers who are not familiar with the English word. When Parker Pen entered the Mexican market its advertisements which claimed that Parker Pens won\t leak in your pocket and embarrass you was mistranslated to No te embarazará chorreándose en tu bolsillo which means Won\t leak in your pocket and impregnate you. The correct way to say I\m embarrassed in Spanish is using the phrase tengo vergüenza meaning I have shame or the more formal phrases me da vergüenza or estoy avergonzado. Yet in Spanish there also exists the adjective embarazoso meaning the same as embarrassing in its denotation of something that causes a sensation of unease but not of shame. Complicating the issue further embarazada can sometimes also mean hampered or hindered. This more closely mirrors the original meaning of the English word embarrass. ,0
158,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emergency_medicine,Emergency medicine formerly known in some countries as accident and emergency medicine is the medical specialty involving care for undifferentiated and unscheduled patients with illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical attention. In their role as first-line providers emergency physicians are responsible for initiating investigations and interventions to diagnose and/or treat patients in the acute phase including initial resuscitation and stabilization coordinating care with physicians from other specialities and making decisions regarding a patients need for hospital admission observation or discharge. Emergency physicians generally practice in hospital emergency departments pre-hospital settings via emergency medical services and intensive care units but may also work in primary care settings such as urgent care clinics. Different models for emergency medicine exist internationally. In countries following the Anglo-American model emergency medicine was originally the domain of surgeons general practitioners and other generalist physicians but in recent decades it has become recognised as a speciality in its own right with its own training programmes and academic posts and the specialty is now a popular choice among medical students and newly qualified medical practitioners. By contrast in countries following the Franco-German model the speciality does not exist and emergency medical care is instead provided directly by anesthesiologists for initial resuscitation surgeons specialists in internal medicine or another speciality as appropriate. In developing countries emergency medicine is still evolving and international emergency medicine programs offer hope of improving basic emergency care where resources are limited. ,0

163,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fnord,Fnord is a word that was coined in 1965 by Kerry Thornley and Greg Hill in the Principia Discordia. It entered the popular culture after appearing in The Illuminatus! Trilogy 1975 of satirical and parody conspiracy fiction novels by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. In these novels the interjection fnord is given hypnotic power over the unenlightened and children in grade school are taught to be unable to consciously see the word fnord. For the rest of their lives every appearance of the word subconsciously generates a feeling of uneasiness and confusion and prevents rational consideration of the subject. The word is often used in newsgroup and hacker culture to indicate that someone is being ironic humorous or surreal.

165,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Free_good,A free good is a good that is not scarce and therefore is available without limits. A free good is available in as great a quantity as desired with zero opportunity cost to society. A good that is made available at zero price is not necessarily a free good. For example a shop might give away its stock in its promotion but producing these goods would still have required the use of scarce resources. Examples of free goods are ideas and works that are reproducible at zero cost or almost zero cost. For example if someone invents a new device many people could copy this invention with no danger of this resource running out. Other examples include computer programs and web pages. Earlier schools of economic thought proposed a third type of free good: resources that are scarce but so abundant in nature that there is enough for everyone to have as much as they want. Examples in textbooks included seawater and air. Intellectual property laws such as copyrights and patents have the effect of converting some intangible goods to scarce goods. Even though these works are free goods by definition and can be reproduced at minimal cost the production of these works does require scarce resources such as skilled labour. Thus these laws are used to give exclusive rights to the creators in order to encourage resources to be appropriately allocated to these activities. Many post scarcity futurists theorize that advanced nanotechnology with the ability to turn any kind of material automatically into any other combination of equal mass will make all goods essentially free goods since all raw materials and manufacturing time will become perfectly interchangeable. ,0
166,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frumenty,Frumenty sometimes frumentee furmity fromity or fermenty was a popular dish in Western European medieval cuisine. It was made primarily from boiled cracked wheat—hence its name which derives from the Latin word frumentum grain. Different recipes added milk eggs or broth. Other recipes include almonds currants sugar saffron and orange flower water. Frumenty was served with meat as a pottage traditionally with venison or occasionally porpoise considered a fish and therefore appropriate for Lent. It was also frequently used as a subtlety. For several centuries frumenty was part of the traditional Celtic Christmas meal. In England it was often eaten on Mothering Sunday the fourth Sunday of Lent. On that day many servants were allowed to visit their mothers and were often served frumenty to celebrate and give them a wholesome meal to prepare them for their return journey. The use of eggs would have been a brief respite from the Lenten fast. In Lincolnshire frumenty was associated with sheep-shearing in June. A diarist recalled of his youth in the 1820s that almost every farmer in the village made a large quantity of frumenty on the morning they began to clip; and every child in the village was invited to partake of it. A second batch of better quality was produced later and taken round in buckets to every house in the village. Frumentee is served with venison at a banquet in the mid-14th century North Midlands poem Wynnere and Wastoure: Venyson with the frumentee and fesanttes full riche / Baken mete therby one the burde sett 334-5. The dish also appears likewise paired with venison at the New Year feast in the Middle English poem known as The Alliterative Morte Arthure c.1400: Flesh flourisht of fermison with frumentee noble. The dish described as \furmity\ and served with fruit and a slug of rum added under the counter plays a major role in the plot of Thomas Hardy\s novel The Mayor of Casterbridge. It is also mentioned in Lewis Carroll\s Through the Looking-Glass as a food that snapdragon flies live on. It has been asserted that frumenty is England\s oldest national dish. A dish made with boiled cracked wheat and soured milk was made in antiquity in Persia and is still used often as the basis for a soup in Greece and Cyprus as trahanas and in Turkey tarhana. ,0

168,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giant_(mythology),Giants are the monsters of human appearance but prodigious size and strength common in the mythology and legends of many different cultures. The word giant coined in 1297 was derived from the gigantes Greek: γίγαντες of Greek mythology. In various Indo-European mythologies gigantic peoples are featured as primeval creatures associated with chaos and the wild nature and they are frequently in conflict with the gods be they Olympian Celtic Hindu or Norse. Giants also often play similar roles in the mythologies and folklore of other non Indo-European peoples such as in the Nartian traditions. There are also accounts of giants in the Old Testament most famously Goliath Og King of Bashan the Nephilim the Anakim and the giants of Egypt mentioned in 1 Chronicles 11:23. Attributed to them are extraordinary strength and physical proportions. Fairy tales such as Jack the Giant Killer have formed the modern perception of giants as stupid and violent monsters sometimes said to eat humans especially children though this is actually a confusion with ogres which are distinctly cannibalistic. The ogre in Jack and the Beanstalk is often described as a giant. In some more recent portrayals like those of Jonathan Swift and Roald Dahl some giants are both intelligent and friendly. ,0
169,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gift,A gift or a present is an item given to someone without the expectation of payment.

In many countries the act of mutually exchanging money goods etc. may sustain social relations and contribute to social cohesion. Economists have elaborated the economics of gift-giving into the notion of a gift economy. By extension the term gift can refer to anything that makes the other happier or less sad especially as a favor including forgiveness and kindness. Gifts are also first and foremost presented on occasions - birthdays and in Western cultures Christmas being the main examples. ,0

From the 3rd century BC the Romans adopted swords similar to those used by the Celtiberians and others during the early part of the conquest of Hispania. This sword was known as the gladius hispaniensis or Hispanic Sword. A fully equipped Roman legionary after the reforms of Gaius Marius was armed with a shield scutum one or two javelins pila a sword gladius often a dagger pugio and perhaps in the later Empire period darts plumbatae. Conventionally the javelins would be thrown to disable the shields and disrupt the formation of the enemy before engaging in close combat for which the gladius would be drawn.

It is usually made from dairy products such as milk and cream and often combined with fruits or other ingredients and flavours. It is typically sweetened with sugar or sugar substitutes. Typically flavourings and colourings are added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures <35 °F / 2 °C. It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases. The meaning of the phrase ice cream varies from one country to another. Phrases such as frozen custard frozen yogurt sorbet gelato and others are used to distinguish different varieties and styles. In some countries such as the United States the phrase ice cream applies only to a specific variety and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients notably the amount of cream. Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are labelled frozen dairy dessert instead. In other countries such as Italy and Argentina one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from dairy alternatives such as goat\s or sheep\s milk or milk substitutes e.g. soy milk or tofu are available for those who are lactose intolerant allergic to dairy protein or vegan. Ice cream may be served in dishes for eating with a spoon or in cones which are licked. Ice cream may be served with other desserts such as apple pie.

178,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Last_Supper,The Last Supper is the final meal that in the Gospel accounts Jesus shared with his Apostles in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. The Last Supper is commemorated by Christians especially on Maundy Thursday. The Last Supper provides the scriptural basis for the Eucharist also known as Holy Communion or The Lord\s Supper. The First Epistle to the Corinthians contains the earliest known mention of the Last Supper. The four canonical Gospels all state that the Last Supper took place towards the end of the week after Jesus\ triumphal entry into Jerusalem and that Jesus and his Apostles shared a meal shortly before Jesus was crucified at the end of that week. During the meal Jesus predicts his betrayal by one of the Apostles present and foretells that before the next morning Peter will deny knowing him. The three Synoptic Gospels and the First Epistle to the Corinthians include the account of the institution of the Eucharist in which Jesus takes bread breaks it and gives it to the Apostles saying: This is my body which is given for you. The Gospel of John does not include this episode but tells of Jesus washing the feet of the Apostles giving the new commandment to love one another as I have loved you and has a detailed farewell discourse by Jesus calling the Apostles who follow his teachings friends and not servants as he prepares them for his departure. Scholars have looked to the Last Supper as the source of early Christian Eucharist traditions. Others see the account of the Last Supper as derived from 1st-century eucharistic practice as described by Paul in the mid-50s. The Last Supper served the dual purpose of venerating Passover the escape of the Jews from slavery in Egypt and the establishment of a new tradition Christianity. ,0

180,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Misznay–Schardin_effect,The Misznay–Schardin effect alternative spelling Misnay-Schardin or platter effect is a characteristic of the detonation of a broad sheet of explosive. The explosive blast expands directly away from perpendicular to the surface of an explosive. Unlike the blast from a rounded explosive charge which expands in all directions the blast produced by an explosive sheet expands primarily perpendicular to its plane in both directions. However if one side is backed by a heavy or fixed mass most of the blast that is most of the rapidly expanding gas and its kinetic energy will be sent in the direction away from the mass. This effect was studied and experimented with by explosive experts József Misznay alternative spelling Misnay a Hungarian and Hubert Schardin a German who initially sought to develop a more effective anti-tank AT mine for Nazi Germany. Some sources claim World War II ended before their design became usable but they and others continued their work. Actually Misznay designed two weapons.

It comes in several different varieties including blood orange. In American English the beverage name may be abbreviated as OJ. Due to the importance of oranges to the economy of the state of Florida the juice obtained from mature oranges of the species Citrus sinensis and hybrids thereof was adopted as the official beverage of Florida in 1967. Orange juice along with grapefruit juice is offered to every visitor at each of the state\s five Florida Welcome Centers. Commercial orange juice with a long shelf life is made by drying and later rehydrating the juice or by concentrating the juice and later adding water to the concentrate. Prior to drying the juice may also be pasteurized and oxygen removed from it necessitating the later addition of a flavor pack generally made from orange products. The health value of orange juice is debatable. It has a high concentration of vitamin C but also a very high concentration of simple sugars comparable to soft drinks such as colas.

The reasons were manifold but mostly rested on historical circumstances of the nation. Polish writers typically have had a more profound range of choices to motivate them to write including historical cataclysms of extraordinary violence that swept Poland as the crossroads of Europe; but also Polands own collective incongruities demanding adequate reaction from the writing communities of any given period. The period of Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s–40s and peaked in the second half of the 18th century. One of the leading Polish Enlightenment authors included Ignacy Krasicki 1735–1801 and Jan Potocki 1761–1815. Polish Romanticism unlike Romanticism elsewhere in Europe was largely a movement for independence against the foreign occupation. Early Polish Romantics were heavily influenced by other European Romantics. Notable writers included Adam Mickiewicz Seweryn Goszczyński Tomasz Zan and Maurycy Mochnacki. In the second period many Polish Romantics worked abroad. Influential poets included Adam Mickiewicz Juliusz Słowacki and Zygmunt Krasiński. In the aftermath of the failed January Uprising the new period of Polish Positivism began to advocate skepticism and the exercise of reason. The modernist period known as the Young Poland movement in visual arts literature and music came into being around 1890 and concluded with the Polands return to independence 1918. Notable authors included Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer Stanisław Przybyszewski and Jan Kasprowicz. The neo-Romantic era was exemplified by the works of Stefan Żeromski Władysław Reymont Gabriela Zapolska and Stanisław Wyspiański. In 1905 Henryk Sienkiewicz received a Nobel Prize in literature for his patriotic Trilogy inspiring a new sense of hope. Literature of the Second Polish Republic 1918-1939 encompasses a short though exceptionally dynamic period in Polish literary consciousness. The socio-political reality has changed radically with Polands return to independence. New avant-garde writers included Tuwim Witkacy Gombrowicz Miłosz Dąbrowska and Nałkowska. In the years of German and Soviet occupation of Poland all artistic life was dramatically compromised. Cultural institutions were lost. Out of 1500 clandestine publications in Poland about 200 were devoted to literature. Much of Polish literature written during the Occupation of Poland appeared in print only after the conclusion of World War II including books by Nałkowska Rudnicki Borowski and others. The situation began to worsen dramatically around 1949–1950 with the introduction of the Stalinist doctrine by minister Sokorski. Poland had three Nobel Prize winning authors in the later 20th century: Isaac Bashevis Singer 1978 Czesław Miłosz 1980 and Wisława Szymborska 1996. ,0
191,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portable_soup,Portable soup was a kind of dehydrated food used in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was a precursor of the later meat extract and bouillon cubes and of industrially dehydrated food. It is also known as pocket soup or veal glew. It is a cousin of the glace de viande of French cooking. It was long a staple of seamen and explorers for it would keep for many months or even years. In this context it was a filling and nutritious dish. Portable soup of less extended vintage was according to the 1881 Household Cyclopedia ...exceedingly convenient for private families for by putting one of the cakes in a saucepan with about a quart of water and a little salt a basin of good broth may be made in a few minutes. ,0
192,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Puff_pastry,Puff pastry also known as pâte feuilletée is a flaky light pastry containing several layers of fat which is in solid state at 20 °C 68 °F. In raw form puff pastry is a laminated dough composed of two elements: a dough packet the détrempe and a butter packet or other solid fat the beurrage. Preparing a classic puff pastry requires an envelope formed by placing the beurrage inside the détrempe. An inverse puff pastry envelope places the détrempe inside the beurrage. The resulting paton is repeatedly folded and rolled out before baking. The gaps that form between the layers left by the fat melting are pushed leavened by the water turning into steam during the baking process. Piercing the dough will prevent excessive puffing and crimping along the sides will prevent the layers from flaking all of the way to the edges. ,0

194,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reserved_word,In a computer language a reserved word also known as a reserved identifier is a word that cannot be used as an identifier such as the name of a variable function or label – it is reserved from use. This is a syntactic definition and a reserved word may have no meaning. A closely related and often conflated notion is a keyword which is a word with special meaning in a particular context. This is a semantic definition. By contrast names in a standard library but not built into the language are not considered reserved words or keywords. The terms reserved word and keyword are often used interchangeably – one may say that a reserved word is reserved for use as a keyword – and formal use varies from language to language; for this article we distinguish as above. In general reserved words and keywords need not coincide but in most modern languages keywords are a subset of reserved words as this makes parsing easier since keywords cannot be confused with identifiers. In some languages like C or Python reserved words and keywords coincide while in other languages like Java all keywords are reserved words but some reserved words are not keywords – these are reserved for future use. In yet other languages such as the older languages ALGOL FORTRAN and PL/I there are keywords but no reserved words with keywords being distinguished from identifiers by other means. This makes parsing more difficult with look-ahead parsers necessary. ,0

201,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simulation,Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time. The act of simulating something first requires that a model be developed; this model represents the key characteristics or behaviors/functions of the selected physical or abstract system or process. The model represents the system itself whereas the simulation represents the operation of the system over time. Simulation is used in many contexts such as simulation of technology for performance optimization safety engineering testing training education and video games. Often computer experiments are used to study simulation models. Simulation is also used with scientific modelling of natural systems or human systems to gain insight into their functioning. Simulation can be used to show the eventual real effects of alternative conditions and courses of action. Simulation is also used when the real system cannot be engaged because it may not be accessible or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage or it is being designed but not yet built or it may simply not exist. Key issues in simulation include acquisition of valid source information about the relevant selection of key characteristics and behaviours the use of simplifying approximations and assumptions within the simulation and fidelity and validity of the simulation outcomes. Procedures and protocols for model verification and validation are an ongoing field of academic study refinement research and development in simulations technology or practice particularly in the field of computer simulation. ,0

206,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taoism,Taoism also known as Daoism is a religious philosophical and ritual tradition of Chinese origin which emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao 道 literally Way also romanized as Dao. Taoist schools function as theoretical and liturgical frameworks for both popular and high cults of broader Chinese religion and some of them the Quanzhen traditions have a distinct monastic institution. The Tao is a fundamental idea in Chinese philosophies and religions other than Taoism; in the latter however it denotes the principle that is both the source and the pattern of development of everything that exists. Taoism differs specifically from Confucian traditions by not emphasizing rigid rituals and social order which are fundamental in the latter. The roots of Taoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE. Early Taoism drew its cosmological notions from the School of Yinyang Naturalists and was deeply influenced by one of the oldest text of Chinese culture the Yijing which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behavior in accordance with the alternating cycles of nature. The Tao Te Ching a compact book containing teachings attributed to Laozi Chinese: 老子; pinyin: Lǎozǐ; Wade–Giles: Lao Tzu is widely considered the keystone work of the Taoist tradition together with the later writings of Zhuangzi. Only by the Han dynasty 3rd century CE the various sources of Taoism coalesced into a coherent tradition of religious organizations and orders of ritualists in the state of Shu modern Sichuan. In earlier ancient China Taoists were thought of as hermits or recluses who did not participate in political life. Zhuangzi was the best known of these and it is significant that he lived in the south where he was part of local Chinese shamanic traditions. Women shamans played an important role in this tradition which was particularly strong in the southern state of Chu. Early Taoist movements developed their own institution in contrast to shamanism but absorbed basic shamanic elements. Shamans revealed basic texts of Taoism from early times down to at least the 20th century. Institutional orders of Taoism evolved in various strains that in more recent times are conventionally grouped into two main branches: Quanzhen Taoism and Zhengyi Taoism. After Laozi and Zhuangzi the literature of Taoism grew steadily and was compiled in form of a canon—the Daozang—which was published at the behest of the emperor. Throughout Chinese history Taoism was nominated several times as a state religion. After the 17th century however it fell from favor. Taoist propriety and ethics may vary depending on the particular school but in general they tend to emphasize wu wei effortless action naturalness simplicity spontaneity and the Three Treasures: jing sperm/ovary energy or the essence of the physical body qi matter-energy or life force including the thoughts and emotions and shén spirit or generative power. Taoism has had a profound influence on Chinese culture in the course of the centuries and Taoists Chinese: 道士; pinyin: dàoshi masters of the Tao a title traditionally attributed only to the clergy and not to their lay followers usually take care to note distinction between their ritual tradition and the practices of Chinese folk religion and non-Taoist vernacular ritual orders which are often mistakenly identified as pertaining to Taoism. Chinese alchemy especially neidan Chinese astrology Chan Zen Buddhism several martial arts traditional Chinese medicine feng shui and many styles of qigong have been intertwined with Taoism throughout history. Beyond China Taoism also had influence on surrounding societies in Asia. Today the Taoist tradition is one of the five religious doctrines officially recognized in the People\s Republic of China PRC as well as Taiwan and although it does not travel readily from its East Asian roots claims adherents in a number of societies. Taoism also has a presence in Hong Kong and in Southeast Asia. ,0

In Spain patrons of tapas can order many different tapas and combine them to make a full meal. In some Central American countries such snacks are known as bocas. In Mexico similar dishes are called botanas. The serving of tapas is designed to encourage conversation because people are not so focused upon eating an entire meal that is set before them.

208,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tea,This article is about the beverage. For other uses see Tea disambiguation.Cup of tea redirects here. For other uses see Cup of Tea.\nTea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis an evergreen shrub native to Asia. After water it is the most widely consumed drink in the world. There are many different types of tea; some teas like Darjeeling and Chinese greens have a cooling slightly bitter and astringent flavour while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet nutty floral or grassy notes. Tea originated in southwestern China where it was used as a medicinal drink. It was popularized as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty and tea drinking spread to other East Asian countries. Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to the West during the 16th century. During the 17th century drinking tea became fashionable among Britons who started large-scale production and commercialization of the plant in India to bypass a Chinese monopoly at that time. The phrase herbal tea usually refers to infusions of fruit or herbs made without the tea plant such as steeps of rosehip chamomile or rooibos. These are also known as tisanes or herbal infusions to distinguish them from tea as it is commonly understood. ,0
209,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tillage,Tillage is the agricultural preparation of soil by mechanical agitation of various types such as digging stirring and overturning. Examples of human-powered tilling methods using hand tools include shovelling picking mattock work hoeing and raking. Examples of draft-animal-powered or mechanized work include ploughing overturning with moldboards or chiseling with chisel shanks rototilling rolling with cultipackers or other rollers harrowing and cultivating with cultivator shanks teeth. Small-scale gardening and farming for household food production or small business production tends to use the smaller-scale methods above whereas medium- to large-scale farming tends to use the larger-scale methods. There is a fluid continuum however. Any type of gardening or farming but especially larger-scale commercial types may also use  or no-till methods as well. Tillage is often classified into two types primary and secondary. There is no strict boundary between them so much as a loose distinction between tillage that is deeper and more thorough primary and tillage that is shallower and sometimes more selective of location secondary. Primary tillage such as ploughing tends to produce a rough surface finish whereas secondary tillage tends to produce a smoother surface finish such as that required to make a good seedbed for many crops. Harrowing and rototilling often combine primary and secondary tillage into one operation. Tillage can also mean the land that is tilled. The word cultivation has several senses that overlap substantially with those of tillage. In a general context both can refer to agriculture. Within agriculture both can refer to any of the kinds of soil agitation described above. Additionally cultivation or cultivating may refer to an even narrower sense of shallow selective secondary tillage of row crop fields that kills weeds while sparing the crop plants. ,0

Tomato sauces are common for meat and vegetables but they are perhaps best known as sauces for pasta dishes. Tomatoes have a rich flavor high liquid content very soft flesh which breaks down easily and the right composition to thicken into a sauce when they are cooked without the need of thickeners such as roux. All of these qualities make them ideal for simple and appealing sauces. The simplest tomato sauces consist just of chopped tomato flesh cooked in a little olive oil and simmered until it loses its raw flavor and seasoned with salt. Optionally tomato skins may be scalded and peeled according to texture especially thicker pelati paste varieties and tomato seeds may be removed to avoid their bitterness. Water or another more flavorful liquid such as stock or wine is sometimes added to keep it from drying out too much. Onion and garlic are almost always sweated or sautéed at the beginning before the tomato is added. Other seasonings typically include basil oregano parsley and possibly some spicy red pepper or black pepper. Ground or chopped meat is also common.In countries such as the United Kingdom Australia New Zealand and South Africa  the term tomato sauce is used to describe a condiment type table sauce similar to that known in the United States as ketchup. In some of these countries both terms are used for the condiment. The use of tomato sauce with pasta appears for the first time in the Italian cookbook L\Apicio moderno by Roman chef Francesco Leonardi edited in 1790. ,0

A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing micro-organism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body\s immune system to recognize the agent as a threat destroy it and keep a record of it so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these micro-organisms that it later encounters. Vaccines can be prophylactic example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or wild pathogen or therapeutic e.g. vaccines against cancer are also being investigated. The administration of vaccines is called vaccination. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified; for example the influenza vaccine the HPV vaccine and the chicken pox vaccine. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio measles and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization WHO reports that licensed vaccines are currently available to prevent or contribute to the prevention and control of twenty-five infections. The terms vaccine and vaccination are derived from Variolae vaccinae smallpox of the cow the term devised by Edward Jenner to denote cowpox. He used it in 1798 in the long title of his Inquiry into the...Variolae vaccinae...known...as]...the Cow Pox in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox.

225,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine,Wine from Latin vinum is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes generally Vitis vinifera or its hybrids with Vitis labrusca or Vitis rupestris. Grapes ferment without the addition of sugars acids enzymes water or other nutrients as yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape the reactions involved in fermentation the terroir the special characteristics imparted by geography geology climate viticultural methods and plant genetics and the production process. Many countries define legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine; these typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes as well as other aspects of wine production. There are also wines made from fermenting other fruits or cereals whose names often specify their base with some having specific names. Wines made from plants other than grapes include rice wine and various fruit wines such as those made from plums or cherries. Some well known example are hard cider from apples perry from pears pomegranate wine and elderberry wine. Wine has been produced for thousands of years. The earliest known evidence of wine comes from Georgia Caucasus where 8000-year-old wine jars were found. Traces of wine have also been found in Iran with 7000-year-old wine jars and in Armenia in the 6100-year old Areni-1 winery the earliest known winery. Wine had reached the Balkans by c.\u20094500 BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient Greece Thrace and Rome. Throughout history wine has been consumed for its intoxicating effects which are evident at normal serving sizes. Wine has long played an important role in religion. Red wine was associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians and was used by both the Greek cult of Dionysus and the Romans in their Bacchanalia; Judaism also incorporates it in the Kiddush and Christianity in the Eucharist. ,0

270,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cheese,Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors textures and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk usually the milk of cows buffalo goats or sheep. During production the milk is usually acidified and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature. Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced. Their styles textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk including the animals diet whether they have been pasteurized the butterfat content the bacteria and mold the processing and aging. Herbs spices or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses such as Red Leicester is produced by adding annatto. Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses such as black pepper garlic chives or cranberries. For a few cheeses the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria which turn milk sugars into lactic acid then the addition of rennet completes the curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus Mucor miehei but others have been extracted from various species of the Cynara thistle family. Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher lower-priced milk and lower shipping costs. Cheese is valued for its portability long life and high content of fat protein calcium and phosphorus. Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese; labels on packets of cheese often claim that a cheese should be consumed within three to five days of opening. Generally speaking hard cheeses such as parmesan last longer than soft cheeses such as Brie or goats milk cheese. The long storage life of some cheeses especially when encased in a protective rind allows selling when markets are favorable. There is some debate as to the best way to store cheese but some experts say that wrapping it in cheese paper provides optimal results. Cheese paper is coated in a porous plastic on the inside and the outside has a layer of wax. This specific combination of plastic on the inside and wax on the outside protects the cheese by allowing condensation on the cheese to be wicked away while preventing moisture from within the cheese escaping. A specialist seller of cheese is sometimes known as a cheesemonger. Becoming an expert in this field requires some formal education and years of tasting and hands-on experience much like becoming an expert in wine or cuisine. The cheesemonger is responsible for all aspects of the cheese inventory: selecting the cheese menu purchasing receiving storage and ripening. ,0

It was launched in the same year as other attempts to extend soft drink brand names with new iterations including Pepsi Blue Dr. Pepper Red Fusion and Vanilla Coke. While dnL remained listed as an official product of the company in late 2005 it was scheduled to be discontinued for 2006 in favor of the 7 Up Plus brand. The product\s name came from the fact that the dnL logo is the 7 Up logo rotated 180°. As such the product itself was in many ways the polar opposite of 7 Up: while 7 Up is caffeine-free colorless and comes in a green bottle dnL contained caffeine was colored vaguely similar to the green of 7 Up\s bottle and came in a clear bottle. And while 7 Up has a fairly standard lemon-lime flavor dnL was a stronger lime-lemon/citrus flavor. The limited amount of marketing created for dnL focused on its upside-down theme including its slogan Turn your thirst upside-down. The color was also similar to Pepsi\s Mountain Dew soft drink and like Mountain Dew was developed primarily to compete with The Coca-Cola Company\s Sprite Fanta and Mello Yello. When this soda got relaunched in select cities it became DNL in all caps with the logo. ,0

282,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earmark_(agriculture),An earmark is a cut or mark in the ear of livestock animals such as cattle deer pigs goats camels or sheep made to show ownership year of birth or gender. The term dates to the 16th century in England. The practice existed in the Near East up to the time of Islam. Against this in Q. 4:119 the Qur\an quotes the Devil promising I will mislead them I will entice them I will command them to mark the ears of livestock and I will command them to distort the creation of God. Earmarks are typically registered when a stock owner registers a livestock brand for their use. There are many rules and regulations concerning the use of earmarks between states and countries. Tasmanian sheep and cattle must be earmarked before they become six months old. Generally the owner’s earmark is placed in a designated ear of a camel or sheep to indicate its gender. Typically if a registered earmark is used it must be applied to the right ear for ewes and the left ear for female camels. The other ear of a sheep then may be used to show the year of its birth. Cattle earmarks are often a variety of knife cuts in the ear as an aid to identification but it does not necessarily constitute proof of ownership. Since the 1950s it has been more common to use ear tags to identify livestock because coloured tags are capable of conveying more information than earmarks. Such ear tags were popularised by New Zealand dairy farmers in the earliest successful use of them. Because of the ubiquity of earmarking in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries it became common parlance to call any identifying mark an earmark. In early times many politicians were country or farming folk and were adept at using such words in different ways and in creating new concepts. Today it is common to refer to an institution\s ability to designate funds for a specific use or owner as an earmark. Also earmark has different meanings in the fields of public finance and politics. ,0

Gumbo is often categorized by the type of thickener used the vegetable okra the Choctaw spice filé powder dried and ground sassafras leaves or roux the French base made of flour and fat. The dish likely derived its name from either a word from a Bantu language for okra ki ngombo or the Choctaw word for filé kombo. Several different varieties exist. Creole gumbo generally contains shellfish tomatoes and a thickener. Cajun gumbo is generally based on a dark roux and is spicier with either shellfish or fowl. Sausage or ham is often added to gumbos of either variety. After the base is prepared vegetables are cooked down and then meat is added. The dish simmers for a minimum of three hours with shellfish and some spices added near the end. If desired filé powder is added after the pot is removed from heat. Gumbo is traditionally served over rice. A third lesser-known variety the meatless gumbo zherbes is essentially a gumbo of slow-cooked greens sometimes thickened with roux with rice served on the side.

Queso blanco and queso fresco make a creamy addition to recipes and are often used as a topping for spicy Mexican dishes such as enchiladas and empanadas or crumbled over soups or salads. Meltable versions are used to make quesadillas. Many Mexican home cooks make their own instead of purchasing it; when made for the evening meal it is often prepared in early afternoon and left to drain until evening. As it is highly perishable it must be refrigerated or used immediately once the whey has drained out. In Peruvian cuisine several recipes mix queso fresco and spices to make a spicy cold sauce eaten over peeled boiled potatoes such as papa a la Huancaína or ocopa. Queso blanco and queso fresco also exist in Brazil and Portugal and are respectively known as queijo branco Portuguese pronunciation: ˈkejʒu ˈbɾɐ̃ku] and queijo fresco ˈkeijʒu ˈfɾeʃku]. A melted cheese appetizer using white American cheese is sometimes called queso blanco dip but the name is merely descriptive. It does not include queso blanco cheese. ,0
325,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queso_flameado,Queso flameado Spanish for flamed cheese; also queso fundido melted cheese or choriqueso is a dish of hot melted cheese and spicy chorizo that is often served flambé. Often compared to cheese fondue it is a party dish; it is popular at cookouts and in restaurants as an appetizer. Almost unique in Mexican cuisine in the cuisine of the United States this dish has been widely adapted and is considered a native dish in El Paso. In Mexico it occurs in restaurants more often in the north.Typical main ingredients are melted cheese and a characteristic meat sauce of loose fresh chorizo tomato onion chile and spices. It is served in a small shallow casserole or other ceramic or metal heat-proof baking dish. The cheese and sauce are prepared separately and combined just before serving. This may be done at the table especially if finished with a flambé: high alcohol liquor is poured on the cheese and ignited and as it burns the server folds in the sauce. If not flambéed the mixture may be quickly broiled. Either way the finished dish is presented while it is still bubbling hot and it is spooned onto small soft tortillas for individual servings. Queso flameado is said to originate in the borderlands of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States as a campfire dish. In Tex-Mex restaurants this dish is sometimes confused or conflated with chili con queso a cheese sauce served with tortilla chips for dipping. The term queso fundido also refers to processed cheese and is defined as such in the Spanish version of Codex Alimentarius. ,0

328,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ripple_(electrical),The most common meaning of ripple in electrical science is the small unwanted residual periodic variation of the direct current DC output of a power supply which has been derived from an alternating current AC source. This ripple is due to incomplete suppression of the alternating waveform within the power supply. As well as this time-varying phenomenon there is a frequency domain ripple that arises in some classes of filter and other signal processing networks. In this case the periodic variation is a variation in the insertion loss of the network against increasing frequency. The variation may not be strictly linearly periodic. In this meaning also ripple is usually to be considered an unwanted effect its existence being a compromise between the amount of ripple and other design parameters. ,0

331,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotch_pie,A Scotch pie or mutton pie is a small double-crust meat pie filled with minced mutton or other meat. It may also be known as a shell pie or mince pie although the latter term is ambiguous to differentiate it from other varieties of savoury pie such as the steak pie steak and kidney pie steak-and-tattie potato pie and so forth. The Scotch pie is believed to originate in Scotland but can be found in other parts of the United Kingdom and is widely sold all over Canada. They are often sold alongside other types of hot food in football grounds traditionally accompanied by a drink of Bovril resulting in the occasional reference to football pies. The traditional filling of mutton is often highly spiced with pepper and other ingredients and is placed inside a shell of hot water crust pastry. An individual piemaker\s precise recipe including the types and quantities of spice used is usually kept a close secret for fear of imitations. It is baked in a round straight-sided tin about 8 cm in diameter and 4 cm high and the top crust which is soft is placed about 1 cm lower than the rim to make a space for adding accompaniments such as mashed potatoes baked beans brown sauce gravy or an egg. Scotch pies are often served hot by take-away restaurants and bakeries and at outdoor events. The hard crust of the pie enables it to be eaten by hand with no wrapping. Typically there is a round hole of about 7.5mm in the centre of the top crust which has given rise to the colloquial name \chimney pie\ in Scotland. ,0
332,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Selah,Selah /ˈsiːlə/ or /ˈsiːləh/ with pronounced audible H; Hebrew: סֶלָה\u200e\u200e also transliterated as selāh is a word used seventy-four times in the Hebrew Bible—seventy-one times in the Psalms and three times in Habakkuk. The meaning of the word is not known though various interpretations are given below. It should not be confused with the Hebrew word sela‘ Hebrew: סֶלַע\u200e\u200e which means rock or in an adjective form like a rock i.e.: firm hard heavy. It is probably either a liturgico-musical mark or an instruction on the reading of the text something like stop and listen. Selah can also be used to indicate that there is to be a musical interlude at that point in the Psalm. The Amplified Bible translates selah as pause and think of that. It can also be interpreted as a form of underlining in preparation for the next paragraph. At least some of the Psalms were sung accompanied by musical instruments and there are references to this in many chapters. Thirty-one of the thirty-nine psalms with the caption To the choir-master include the word selah. Selah may indicate a break in the song whose purpose is similar to that of Amen Hebrew: so be it in that it stresses the truth and importance of the preceding passage; this interpretation is consistent with the meaning of the Semitic root ṣ-l-ḥ also reflected in Arabic cognate salih variously valid in the logical sense of truth-preserving] honest and righteous. Alternatively selah may mean forever as it does in some places in the liturgy notably the second to last blessing of the Amidah. Another interpretation claims that selah comes from the primary Hebrew root word salah סָלָה which means to hang and by implication to measure weigh. ,0

341,http://dbpedia.org/resource/T-bone_steak,The T-bone and porterhouse are steaks of beef cut from the short loin called the sirloin in Commonwealth countries. Both steaks include a T-shaped bone with meat on each side. Porterhouse steaks are cut from the rear end of the short loin and thus include more tenderloin steak along with on the other side of the bone a large strip steak. T-bone steaks are cut closer to the front and contain a smaller section of tenderloin. There is little agreement among experts on how large the tenderloin must be to differentiate a T-bone steak from porterhouse. The U.S. Department of Agriculture\s Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications state that the tenderloin of a porterhouse must be at least 1.25 inches 32 mm thick at its widest while that of a T-bone must be at least 0.5 inches 13 mm. However steaks with a large tenderloin are often called a T-bone in restaurants and steakhouses despite technically being porterhouse. Owing to their large size and the fact that they contain meat from two of the most prized cuts of beef the short loin and the tenderloin T-bone steaks are generally considered one of the highest quality steaks and prices at steakhouses are accordingly high. Porterhouse steaks are even more highly valued owing to their larger tenderloin. In the United States the T-bone has the meat-cutting classification IMPS 1174; the porterhouse is IMPS 1173. In British usage followed in Commonwealth countries porterhouse refers to the strip steak side of a T-bone steak while the tenderloin side is called the fillet. ,0

Bauman and his team were instrumental in creating the first solid food consumed by a NASA astronaut: small food cubes eaten by Scott Carpenter on board Aurora 7 in 1962. John Glenn had consumed the fruit-flavored drink Tang in space three months earlier aboard the Friendship 7. Space food cubes were followed by other space-friendly foods created by Pillsbury\s food engineers such as non-crumbly cake relish that could be served in slices and meat that needed no refrigeration. In 1970 Pillsbury filed for a trademark for a non-frozen balance energy snack in rod form containing nutritionally balanced amounts of carbohydrate fat and protein which they dubbed Space Food Sticks. No basis for use of the term nutritionally balanced was provided. A forerunner of energy bars Space Food Sticks were promoted by Pillsbury for their association with NASA\s efforts to create safe healthy and nutritional space food. In 1972 astronauts on board Skylab 3 ate modified versions of Space Food Sticks to test their gastrointestinal compatibility. Capitalizing on the popularity of the Apollo space missions Pillsbury marketed Space Food Sticks as a nutritionally balanced between meal snack. Fourteen individually packaged sticks were included in a box and came in six flavors such as peanut butter caramel and chocolate. Space Food Sticks disappeared from North American supermarket shelves in the 1980s. They were revived by Retrofuture Products of Port Washington NY in 2006. Two flavors chocolate and peanut butter were released. They are being sold at flight museums such as the Kennedy Space Center and the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum as well as online. In Australia Space Food Sticks were produced for many years in fewer flavor varieties than the American versions chocolate and caramel only. They were marketed under the Nestlé Starz brand to modern-day Australian children as an energy food. Production stopped in 2014. Space Food Sticks have shown up in popular culture including the TV series The Simpsons and The Colbert Report the books of R.L. Stine and the film Super 8. They are frequently cited as the favorite snack of Australian Olympic gold medal winner Ian Thorpe. ,0

424,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spiral_valve,A spiral valve or scroll valve is the corkscrew shaped lower portion of the intestine of some sharks Acipenseriformes sturgeon and paddlefish rays skates bichirs and lungfishes. A modification of the ileum the spiral valve is internally twisted or coiled to increase the surface area of the intestine to increase nutrient absorption. The intestines of a shark are much shorter than those of mammals. Sharks have compensated for this problem by having a spiral valve or a scroll valve inside the intestine to increase the absorbent surface of the intestine. By keeping digestible material in the ileum for an extended period maximum nutrient absorption is ensured. For this reason many sharks and related fish feed very infrequently. The food passes into the comparatively short colon of the shark almost fully digested and then out the cloaca and vent. A consequence of the spiral valve constricting the lumen of the ileum is that sharks cannot pass large hard objects such as bones through their lower intestine. Such objects rather remain in the stomach until sufficiently broken down for passing through the valve region or are regurgitated. Consequently shark stomachs often contain items of interest that enable one to determine what the animals feed on as well as non-food items ingested during a feeding frenzy. Sharks also possess a rectal gland that removes excess salt. ,0

The current edition the game\s fifth was written by David Chart and published in 2004 by Atlas Games who continue to develop new material for it. Ars Magica was one of the first examples of a Troupe system. Early editions recommended that the players collaborate to create the campaign world and story: \n*  Each player having an opportunity to be Story Guide. e.g. alternating by play session \chapter\ of a story or at the whim of the troupeThis scheme has been de-emphasised in recent editions; in Fifth Edition it is relegated to an optional play style described at the back of the book. Alternatively a troupe may select one player as alpha story guide with responsibility for the overall plot and one or more beta story guides to run peripheral sessions and/or stories. \n*  Each player having more than one character; when the primary character lacks opportunity or reason to participate in a session typically due to laboratory or library activity a secondary character is played. To enhance the \authenticity\ of the historical setting the game uses medieval Latin for a number of key terms particularly in the game\s most prominent feature a system of Hermetic Magic. ,0
432,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bobsleigh,Bobsleigh or bobsled is a winter sport in which teams of two or four teammates make timed runs down narrow twisting banked iced tracks in a gravity-powered sled. The timed runs are combined to calculate the final score. The various types of sleds came several years before the first tracks were built in St. Moritz Switzerland where the original bobsleds were adapted upsized luge/skeleton sleds designed by the adventurously wealthy to carry passengers. All three types were adapted from boys delivery sleds and toboggans. Competition naturally followed and to protect the working class and rich visitors in the streets and byways of St Moritz bobsledding was eventually banned from the public highway. In the winter of 1903/1904 the Badrutt family owners of the historic Kulm Hotel and the Palace Hotel allowed Emil Thoma to organise the construction of the first familiarly configured half-pipe track in the Kulm Hotel Park ending in the village of Cresta. It has hosted the sport during two Olympics and is still in use today. International bobsleigh competitions are governed by the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation also known as FIBT from the French Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing. National competitions are often governed by bodies such as the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation and Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton. ,0
433,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dressage,Dressage /ˈdrɛsɑːʒ/ or /drᵻˈsɑːʒ/; a French term most commonly translated to mean training is a highly skilled form of riding performed in exhibition and competition as well as an art sometimes pursued solely for the sake of mastery. As an equestrian sport defined by the International Equestrian Federation dressage is the highest expression of horse training where horse and rider are expected to perform from memory a series of predetermined movements. Competitions are held at all levels from amateur to the Olympic Games and World Equestrian Games. Its fundamental purpose is to develop through standardized progressive training methods a horse\s natural athletic ability and willingness to perform thereby maximizing its potential as a riding horse. At the peak of a dressage horse\s gymnastic development the horse responds smoothly to a skilled rider\s minimal aids. The rider is relaxed and appears effort-free while the horse willingly performs the requested movement. The discipline has a rich history with ancient roots in the writings of Xenophon. Modern dressage has evolved as an important equestrian pursuit since the Renaissance when Federico Grisone\s The Rules of Riding was published in 1550 the first treatise on equitation in over a thousand years since Xenophon\s On Horsemanship. Much about training systems used today reflects practices of classical dressage. In modern dressage competition successful training at the various levels is demonstrated through the performance of tests prescribed series of movements ridden within a standard arena. Judges evaluate each movement on the basis of an objective standard appropriate to the level of the test and assign each movement a score from zero to ten – zero being not executed and 10 being excellent. A score of 9 is very good and is a high mark while a competitor achieving all 6s or 60% overall should be considering moving on to the next level. ,0

Role-playing game products have been produced for the setting ever since as have various licensed products including sword and sorcery novels role-playing video game adaptations including the first massively multiplayer online role-playing game to use graphics and comic books. The Forgotten Realms is one of the most popular D&D settings largely due to the success of novels by authors such as R. A. Salvatore and numerous role-playing video games including Pool of Radiance 1988 Baldur\s Gate 1998 Icewind Dale 2000 and Neverwinter Nights 2002. Forgotten Realms is the name of a fantasy world setting described as a world of strange lands dangerous creatures and mighty deities where magic and supernatural phenomena are quite real. The premise is that long ago the Earth and the world of the Forgotten Realms were more closely connected. As time passed the inhabitants of planet Earth have mostly forgotten about the existence of that other world – hence the term Forgotten Realms. On the original Forgotten Realms logo which was used until 2000 small runic letters read Herein lie the lost lands an allusion to the connection between the two worlds. ,0

But if the seeker tags another player before reaching home base that person becomes it. The game is an example of an oral tradition as it is commonly passed by children. ,0
440,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ice_dancing,Ice dancing is a discipline of figure skating that draws from ballroom dancing. It joined the World Figure Skating Championships in 1952 and became a Winter Olympic Games medal sport in 1976. As in pair skating dancers compete as a couple consisting of a man and a woman. Ice dance differs from pair skating by having different requirements for lifts. Couples must perform spins as a team in a dance hold and throws and jumps are disallowed. Typically partners are not supposed to separate by more than two arm lengths. Originally partners were supposed to be in a dance hold the entire program though modern ice dancing has lifted this restriction somewhat. Another distinction between ice dance and other skating disciplines is the use of music in the performances. In ice dancing dancers must always skate to music with a definite beat or rhythm. Singles and pair skaters more often skate to the melody and phrasing of their music rather than its beat. This is severely penalized in ice dance. In some non-ISU competitions solo dancers may also compete. ,0

456,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spelljammer,Spelljammer is a campaign setting for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition role-playing game which features a fantastic as opposed to scientific outer space environment. Spelljammer introduced into the AD&D universe a comprehensive system of fantasy astrophysics including the Ptolemaic concept of crystal spheres. Crystal spheres may contain multiple worlds and are navigable using ships equipped with spelljamming helms. Ships powered by spelljamming helms are capable of flying into not only the sky but into space. With their own fields of gravity and atmosphere the ships have open decks and tend not to resemble the spaceships of science fiction but instead look more like galleons animals birds fish or even more wildly fantastic shapes. The Spelljammer setting is designed to allow the usual sword and sorcery adventures of Dungeons & Dragons to take place within the framework of outer space tropes. Flying ships travel through the vast expanses of interplanetary space visiting moons and planets and other stellar objects. Like the Planescape setting Spelljammer unifies most of the other AD&D settings and provides a canonical method for allowing characters from one setting such as Dragonlance to travel to another such as the Forgotten Realms. However unlike Planescape it keeps all of the action on the Prime Material Plane and uses the crystal spheres and the phlogiston between them to form natural barriers between otherwise incompatible settings. Though the cosmology is derived largely from the Ptolemaic system of astronomy many of the ideas owe much to the works of Jules Verne and his contemporaries and to related games and fiction with a steampunk or planetary romance flavor. A strong Age of Sail flavor is also present. ,0
457,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sport_of_athletics,Athletics is a collection of sporting events that involve competitive running jumping throwing and walking. The most common types of athletics competitions are track and field road running cross country running and race walking. The results of racing events are decided by finishing position or time where measured while the jumps and throws are won by the athlete that achieves the highest or furthest measurement from a series of attempts. The simplicity of the competitions and the lack of a need for expensive equipment makes athletics one of the most commonly competed sports in the world. Athletics is mostly an individual sport with the exception of relay races and competitions which combine athletes\ performances for a team score such as cross country. Organized athletics are traced back to the Ancient Olympic Games from 776 BCE. The rules and format of the modern events in athletics were defined in Western Europe and North America in the 19th and early 20th century and were then spread to other parts of the world. Most modern top level meetings are conducted by the International Association of Athletics Federations and its member federations. The athletics meeting forms the backbone of the Summer Olympics. The foremost international athletics meeting is the IAAF World Championships in Athletics which incorporates track and field marathon running and race walking. Other top level competitions in athletics include the IAAF World Cross Country Championships and the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships. Athletes with a physical disability compete at the Summer Paralympics and the IPC Athletics World Championships. The word athletics is derived from the Ancient Greek ἀθλητής athlētēs combatant in public games from ἆθλον athlon prize or ἆθλος athlos competition. Initially the term was used to describe athletic contests in general – i.e. sporting competition based primarily on human physical feats. In the 19th century the term athletics acquired a more narrow definition in Europe and came to describe sports involving competitive running walking jumping and throwing. This definition continues to be the most prominent one in the United Kingdom and most of the areas of the former British Empire. Furthermore foreign words in many Germanic and Romance languages which are related to the term athletics also have a similar meaning. In much of North America athletics is synonymous with sports in general maintaining a more historic usage of the term. The word athletics is rarely used to refer to the sport of athletics in this region. Track and field is preferred and is used in the United States and Canada to refer to most athletics events including racewalking and marathon running although cross country running is typically considered as a separate sport. ,0

The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point while the opposite player will. Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham England in the late 19th century as lawn tennis. It had close connections both to various field lawn games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport of real tennis. During most of the 19th century in fact the term tennis referred to real tennis not lawn tennis: for example in Disraeli\s novel Sybil 1845 Lord Eugene De Vere announces that he will go down to Hampton Court and play tennis. The rules of tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point challenge system which allows a player to contest the line call of a point. Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four Grand Slam tournaments also referred to as the Majors are especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts the French Open played on red clay courts Wimbledon played on grass courts and the US Open played also on hard courts. ,0

Two modules detailing countries were released in 1982 Warrior Lords of Darok and Forest Lords of Dihad. Metagaming also published two magazines that featured TFT material. The development of the component MicroGames and some early articles are covered in The Space Gamer. After The Space Gamer was sold to Steve Jackson Metagaming debuted a second house organ called Interplay which produced material related to all Metagaming products but focused primarily on TFT. Jackson left Metagaming in 1980. By that time Howard M. Thompson the owner of Metagaming was not happy with the TFT work done by Steve Jackson stating that it was too complex and had taken too long. During 1983 Thompson closed down the company and sold most of its assets. Jackson tried to purchase the rights to The Fantasy Trip but Thompson\s asking price of $250000 was much too high and TFT is now out of print. Instead Jackson started work on a new third generation role-playing system. The eventual result was GURPS which was strongly influenced by The Fantasy Trip. ,0

471,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volleyball,Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other teams court under organized rules. It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since 1964. The complete rules are extensive. But simply play proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a rally by serving the ball tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm from behind the back boundary line of the court over the net and into the receiving teams court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to 3 times but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. Typically the first two touches are used to set up for an attack an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court. The rally continues with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches until either 1: a team makes a kill grounding the ball on the opponents court and winning the rally; or 2: a team commits a fault and loses the rally. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally. A few of the most common faults include: \n*  causing the ball to touch the ground or floor outside the opponents court or without first passing over the net; \n*  catching and throwing the ball; \n*  double hit: two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same player; \n*  four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same team; \n*  net foul: touching the net during play; \n*  foot fault: the foot crosses over the boundary line when serving. The ball is usually played with the hands or arms but players can legally strike or push short contact the ball with any part of the body. A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball including spiking and blocking because these plays are made above the top of the net the vertical jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport as well as passing setting and specialized player positions and offensive and defensive structures. ,0

510,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dark_Sun,Dark Sun is an original Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting set in the fictional post-apocalyptic desert world of Athas. Dark Sun is notable for its innovative metaplot influential art work dark themes and its genre bending take on traditional fantasy role-playing game. The product line began with the original Dark Sun Boxed Set released for AD&D in 1991 ran until 1996 and was one of TSRs most successful releases. In 2010 Wizards of the Coast released an updated version of the setting using the fourth edition rules. Dark Sun deviated from the feudalistic backdrops of its contemporaries such as Greyhawk or Forgotten Realms in favor of a composite of dark fantasy planetary romance and the Dying Earth subgenre. Rather than create another pseudo-medieval Tolkienesque fantasy world Dark Suns designers presented a savage magic-ravaged desert world where resources are scarce and survival is a daily struggle. The traditional fantasy races and character classes were altered or omitted to better suit the settings darker themes. Dark Sun differs further in that the game has no deities arcane magic is reviled for causing the planets current ecological fragility and psionics are extremely common due to a tie-in with the 1991 Complete Psionics Handbook. The artwork of Brom inspired the direction of the content and established a trend of game products produced under the direction of a single artist. The second edition of the setting was supported by supplements as well as novels were closely tied into the games metaplot. It was the first TSR setting to come with an established metaplot out of the box. Dark Suns popularity endured long after the setting was no longer supported by Dungeons & Dragons new parent company Wizards of the Coast with a lively online community developing in its place. Material was produced for the third edition rules by fans at Athas.org and by Paizo via open game license agreements. A new edition of Dark Sun was released in 2010 for the fourth edition of D&D. The game designers wanted to capture the feel of the original 1991 boxed set while opening up the setting to all of the possible adventures and options offered by the new edition. Though not technically a reboot some of the characters races and setting details from the previous editions were changed or removed. The new setting rules continued Dark Suns tradition of innovation by introducing character themes which provided background character elements and additional powers to newly created characters. Many former variant classes such as elemental priests gladiators and templars were replaced with these character themes. ,0
